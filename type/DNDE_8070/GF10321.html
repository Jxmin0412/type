approached the altar, was dion, the lover who had perilled his life for her sake. her eyes rested intently<br>
on his figure, her whole heart yearned towards him and, unable to control herself, she called his name<br>
aloud. charmian gazed anxiously around the group, but uttered a sigh of relief; for the tall man<br>
whose arm supported dion was gorgias, the worthy architect, his best friend, and the other, still taller<br>
and stronger, her own brother archibius. yonder figure, emerging from the disguise of wraps, was<br>
Berenike, barines mother. all trustworthy confidants the only person whom she did not know was the<br>
handsome young man standing at her brothers side. barine, whose arm she still held, had struggled to<br>
escape to rush to her mother and lover; but archibius had approached, and in a whisper warned her to<br>
be patient and to refrain from any greeting or question, supposing, he added, that you are willing to<br>
be married at this altar to dion, the son of eumenes. charmian felt barines arm tremble in hers at this<br>
suggestion, but the young beauty obeyed her friends directions. she did not know what had befallen<br>
her, or whether, in the excess of happiness which overwhelmed her, to shout aloud in her exultant joy,<br>
or melt into silent tears of gratitude and emotion. no one spoke. archibius took a roll of manuscript<br>
from dions hand, presented himself before the assembled company as the brides kyrios, or guardian,<br>
and asked barine whether she so recognized him. then he returned to dion the marriage contract, whose<br>
contents he knew and approved, and informed those present that, in the marriage about to be<br>
occurred; for mr. marrowfat, the pea merchant of covent garden, and mr. barrowbed, the feathermonger<br>
of drury lane, in their zeal for the good cause, arising at the same moment, big with ardour and<br>
sentiment, to address the chair on a subject of the most momentous importance in their consideration,<br>
and desirous to signalize themselves individually, so completely defeated their objects by over anxiety to<br>
gain precedence, that they rolled over each other on the floor, to the inexpressible amusement of the<br>
company, and the total obliteration of their intended observations; so much so that the harangue<br>
meant to enlighten their friends, ended in a fine colloquy of abuse upon each other, the bottles, the<br>
glasses, and the other paraphernalia of the table suffered considerable diminution in the descent of<br>
these modern ciceros, and a variety of speakers arising upon their downfall, created so much confusion,<br>
that our heroes, fearing it would be some time before harmony could be restored, took up their hats<br>
and walked, now, said dashall, as they left the house, you have had a full view of the pleasantries of a<br>
political dinner; and having seen the characters by which such an entertainment is generally attended,<br>
any further account of them is almost rendered useless. at least, replied tallyho, i have been gratified<br>
by the view of some of the leading men who contribute to fill up the columns of your london<br>
newspapers. egad said his cousin, now i think of it, there is a tine opportunity of amusing ourselves<br>
a trustworthy escort. may i be allowed to ask who why not it was pontius the architect who was with<br>
me. he knows the town well, and in his care i would trust myself to descend, like orpheus, into hades.<br>
happy pontius most happy verus what am i to understand by those words, charming balbilla the poor<br>
architect is able to please by being a good guide, while to you belongs the whole heart of lucilla, your<br>
sweet wife. and she has the whole of mine so far as it is not full of balbilla. good night, saucy muse;<br>
sleep well. sleep ill, you incorrigible tormentor cried the girl, drawing the curtain across her window.<br>
viithe sleepless wretch on whom his trouble has fallen, so long as night surrounds him, sees his<br>
future life as a boundless sea in which he is sailing round and round like a shipwrecked man, but when<br>
the darkness yields, the new and helpful day shows him a boat for escape close at hand, and friendly<br>
shores in the distance. the unfortunate pollux also awoke towards morning with sighs many and deep;<br>
for it seemed to him that last evening he had wined his whole future prospects. the workshop of his<br>
former master was henceforth closed to him, and he no longer possessed even all the tools requisite for<br>
the exercise of his art. only yesterday he had hoped with happy confidence to establish himself on a<br>
footing of his own, to day this seemed impossible, for the most indispensable means were lacking to<br>
him. he felt his little money bag, which he was wont to place under his pillow, he could not forbear<br>
