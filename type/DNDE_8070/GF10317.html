the world isnt the fire lit he said sharply. you must have known i couldnt sit without a fire on a cold<br>
evening like this; and the wind sang dismally in the joints of the windows to emphasise the dreariness<br>
of the situation. it aint nothing to do with me, answered the red armed, coal besmeared hoyden,<br>
looking up from her knees; its the missus. 'he was put out with the coal bill last time, she says, 'and<br>
i aint going to risk lighting up his fire with coal at sixpence a scuttle, and me not knowing whether<br>
hes coming back to night. well, you might see at any rate that the fire was properly laid, the architect<br>
said, as the lighting process gave evident indications of failing for the third time. i do my best, she<br>
said in a larmoyant tone, but i cant do everything, what with having to cook, and clean, and up<br>
and down stairs with notes, and answer the bell every other minute to lords. has lord blandamer been<br>
here asked westray. yes, he came yesterday and twice to day to see you, she said, and then he left a<br>
note. there tis and she pointed to the end of the mantelpiece. westray looked round, and saw an<br>
envelope edged in black. he knew the strong, bold hand of the superscription well enough, and in his<br>
present mood it sent something like a thrill of horror through him. you neednt wait, he said quickly to<br>
the servant; it isnt your fault at all about the fire. im sure its going to burn now. the girl rose quickly<br>
to her feet, gave an astonished glance at the grate, which was once more enveloped in impotent<br>
idle, he may say to himself: now i might get well, but my little girl at home does not love me, for she<br>
would rather sit with her hands in her lap than sort herbs for her sick father. then nefert turned to a<br>
large group of the girls, who were sorting plants, and said: do you, children, know the origin of all<br>
these wholesome, healing herbs the good horus went out to fight against seth, the murderer of his<br>
father, and the horrible enemy wounded horus in the eye in the struggle; but the son of osiris<br>
conquered, for good always conquers evil. but when isis saw the bad wound, she pressed her son to her<br>
bosom, and her heart was sad as that of any poor human mother that holds her suffering<br>
child in her arms, and she thought: how, easy it is to give wounds, and how hard it is to heal them<br>
and so she wept; one tear after another fell on the earth, and wherever they wetted the ground there<br>
sprang up a kindly healing plant. isis is good cried a little girl opposite to her. mother says isis loves<br>
children when they are good. your mother is right, replied nefert. isis herself has her dear little son<br>
horus; and every human being that dies, and that was good, becomes a child again, and the goddess<br>
makes it her own, and takes it to her breast, and nurses it with her sister nephthys till he grows up<br>
and can fight for his father. nefert observed that while she spoke one of the women was crying, she<br>
went up to her, and learned that her husband and her son were both dead, the former in syria, and the<br>
you and i are to have the little room at the head of the stairs all to ourselves. matildas news was<br>
lengthy enough and interesting enough to make us late for tea, and mine kept us awake for a couple<br>
of hours after we were fairly in our two little iron bedsteads in the room that was now our very own.<br>
that is to say, i told what i had to tell after we came to bed, but my news was so lame compared with<br>
matildas that we soon returned to the discussion of hers. i tried to describe my great grandfathers<br>
sketches, but neither aunt theresa in the drawing room, nor matilda when we retired for the night,<br>
seemed to feel any interest in the subject; and when mrs. buller asked what sort of people called at the<br>
vine, i felt that my reply was, like the rest of my news, but dull. matildas, on the contrary, was very<br>
entertaining, she spoke enthusiastically of miss perry, the governess. she is so good nalured, margery,<br>
you cant think. when lessons are over she takes us for walks on the esplanade, and she calls me<br>
matilda, and i take her arm, and she tells me all about herself. she says she knows shes very<br>
romantic, and shes got lots of secrets, and shes told me several already; for she says she has a feeling<br>
that i can keep a secret, and so i can. but telling yous not telling, you know, because shes sure to tell<br>
you herself; only youd better wait till she does before you say anything, for fear she should be vexed.<br>
of course i promised to d–æ so, and craned my neck out of bed to catch matildas interesting but<br>
whispered revelations, matilda herself was only partially in miss perrys confidence, and i looked<br>
anxiously forward to the time when she would admit me also to her secrets, though i feared she might</p>
