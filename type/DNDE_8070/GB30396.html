<p>into the humble plot of ground, and then said in a subdued voice what a lovely creature but what is<br>
she doing with the old man, to be praying, and she first holds a handkerchief before his<br>
mouth, and then rubs his temples. and how unhappy she looks the paraschites must be ill, replied bent<br>
anat. he must have had too much wine down at the feast, said rameri laughing. no doubt of it only<br>
look how his lips tremble, and his eyes roll. it is hideous he looks like one possessed, it was thought<br>
that the insane were possessed by demons. a stele admirably treated by f. de rouge exists at paris,<br>
which relates that the sister in law of rameses iii., who was possessed by devils, had them driven out by<br>
the statue of chunsu, which was sent to her in asia, he is unclean too said nefert. but he is a good,<br>
kind man, with a tender heart, exclaimed the princess eagerly. i have enquired about him. he is honest<br>
and sober, and i am sure he is ill and not drunk. now she is standing up, said rameri, and he dropped<br>
the paper lantern which he had bought at a booth. step back, bent anat, she must be expecting some<br>
one. did you ever see any one so very fair, and with such a pretty little head. even her red hair becomes<br>
her wonderfully; but she staggers as she stands she must be very weak. now she has sat down again<br>
by the old man, and is rubbing his forehead. poor souls look how she is sobbing. i will throw my<br>
purse over to them. no, no exclaimed bent anat. i gave them plenty of money, and the tears which are<br>
shed there cannot be staunched with gold. i will send old asnath over to morrow to ask how we can<br>
help them. look, here comes the procession, nefert. how rudely the people press as soon as the god is<br>

mirror; he looked into the clear metal pane, and laid it back in its place again, as if he had seen some<br>
strange and displeasing countenance. the events of the last few hours had moved him deeply, and<br>
shaken his confidence in his unerring judgment of men and things. the priests on the other bank of the<br>
nile were bent anals counsellors, and he had heard the princess spoken of as a devout and gifted<br>
maiden. her incautious breach of the sacred institutions had seemed to him to offer a welcome<br>
opportunity for humiliating a member of the royal family, now he told himself that he had undervalued<br>
this young creature that he had behaved clumsily, perhaps foolishly, to her; for he did not for a<br>
moment conceal from himself that her sudden change of demeanor resulted much more from the warm<br>
flow of her sympathy, or perhaps of her, affection, than from any recognition of her guilt, and he<br>
could not utilize her transgression with safety to himself, unless she felt herself guilty. nor was he of<br>
so great a nalure to be wholly free from vanity, and his vanity had been deeply wounded by the<br>
haughty resistance of the princess. when he commanded pentaur to meet the princess with words of<br>
reproof, he had hoped to awaken his ambition through the proud sense of power over the mighty ones<br>
of the earth, and now how had his gifted admirer, the most hopeful of all his disciples, stood the test.<br>
