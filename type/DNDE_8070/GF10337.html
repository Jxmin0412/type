declines acknowledging. similarly situated, it would appear the dutchman mentioned by the late<br>
doctor walcot, my broder is te poet, look, as all te world must please, for he heb wrote, py gol, a book<br>
as big as all this cheese on the other hand, collins, hammond, and gray, wrote each of them but little,<br>
yet their names will descend to posterity and had gray, of his poems the bard, and the elegy in a<br>
country church yard, written only one, and written nothing else, he had required no better<br>
passport to immortality of that great and multitudinous writer, doctor samuel johnson, the following<br>
anecdote is told: being one morning in the library at buckingham house honoured with the presence of<br>
royalty, the king, his late majesty, inquired why he, mr. johnson did not continue to write. may it<br>
please your majesty, answered the doctor, i think i have written enough. i should have thought so too,<br>
his majesty replied, if, doctor johnson, you had not written so well. in this opinion the visitants, who<br>
were both well conversant with our native literature, readily acquiesced. have you never, asked dashall,<br>
thought of publishing a volume by subscription i meditated such intention, answered the poet, not long<br>
ago; drew up the necessary prospectus, with a specimen of the poetry, and perambulated the metropolis<br>
in search of patronage. in some fee instances i was successful, and, though limited the number, yet the<br>
high respectability of my few subscribers gave me inexpressible satisfaction; several of our nobility<br>
honoured me with their names, and others, my patrons, were of the very first class of literature.<br>
nevertheless, i encountered much contumelious reception; and after an irksome and unavailing<br>
perseverance of a months continuance, i was at last compelled to relinquish all hope of success. having<br>
near ten oclock, and he was finishing his supper, when someone tapped at the door, and miss euphemia<br>
joliffe came in. i beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir, she said; i am a little anxious about mr<br>
sharnall. he was not in at teatime, and has not come back since. i thought you might know perhaps<br>
where he was. it is years since he has been out so late in the evening. i havent the least idea where he<br>
is, westray said rather testily, for he was tired with a long days work. i suppose he has gone out<br>
somewhere to supper. no one ever asks mr sharnall out. i do not think he can be gone out to supper.<br>
oh, well, i dare say he will turn up in due course; let me hear before you go to bed if he has come<br>
back; and he poured himself out another cup of tea, for he was one of those thin blooded and old<br>
womanly men who elevate the drinking of tea instead of other liquids into a special merit, he could not<br>
understand, he said, why everybody did not drink lea. it was so much more refreshing one could work<br>
so much better after drinking tea. he turned to some calculations for the section of a tie rod, with<br>
which sir george farquhar had at last consented to strengthen the south side of the tower, and did not<br>
notice how time passed till there was another irritating tap, and his landlady reappeared. it is nearly<br>
twelve oclock, she said, and we have seen nothing of mr sharnall. i am so alarmed i am sure i am very<br>
sorry to trouble you, mr westray, but my niece and i are so alarmed. i dont quite see what i am to do,<br>
westray said, looking up. could he have gone out with lord blandamer do you think lord blandamer<br>
could have asked him to fording lord blandamer was here this afternoon, miss joliffe answered, but he<br>
feathers to show how much flaps was in the wrong, and then puffed them out to show how much she<br>
was in the right; and after clearing her throat almost as if she were going to crow, she observed very<br>
shrilly that she didnt care who contradicted her when she said that the common sense of the mother of<br>
a family was enough to tell her that an old dog, who had lost an eye and an ear and a leg was no fit<br>
protector for the feminine and the young and the inexperienced. the chief cock was as free of his<br>
opinions as the chief hen, but he grumbled and scolded about everything, by which one may make<br>
matters amply unpleasant without committing oneself or incurring responsibility, another of the hens<br>
made a point of having no opinion. she said that was her way, she trusted everybody alike and bore<br>
her share of suffering, which was seldom small, without a murmur. but her good wishes were always at<br>
ones service, and she would say that she sincerely hoped that a sad injustice had not been done to<br>
the red haired gentleman with the singularly agreeable manners, who would have been gatekeeper of<br>
hencastle at this moment if it had not been for flaps. poor flaps well might he say, one ear is enough<br>
