euphemia money as a gift; she wouldnt accept it on any condition. i know her quite well enough to be<br>
sure of that. but if i was to offer her twenty pounds for it, and tell her it must always stop here, and<br>
that she could buy it back from me when she was able, i think she would feel such an offer to be a<br>
godsend, and accept it readily, yes, westray said dubitatively; i suppose it couldnt be construed into<br>
an attempting to outwit her, could it it seems rather funny at first sight to get her to sell a picture for<br>
twenty pounds for which others have offered fifty pounds. no, i dont think so, replied the organist. it<br>
wouldnt be a real sale at all, you know, but only just a colour for helping her. well, as you have been<br>
kind enough to ask my advice, i am no further objection, and think it very good of you to show such<br>
thoughtfulness for poor miss joliffe. thank you, said the organist hesitatingly thank you; i had hoped<br>
you would take that view of the matter. there is a further little difficulty: i am as poor as a church<br>
mouse. i live like an old screw, and never spend a penny, but, then, i havent got a penny to spend, and<br>
cant save. westray had already wondered how mr sharnall could command so large a sum as twenty<br>
pounds, but thought it more prudent to make no comments. then the organist took the bull by the<br>
horns. i didnt know, he said, whether you would feel inclined to join me in the purchase. i have got ten<br>
pounds in the savings bank; if you could find the other ten pounds, we could go shares in the picture;<br>
and, after all, that wouldnt much matter, for miss euphemia is quite sure to buy it back from us<br>
before very long. he stopped and looked at westray. the architect was taken aback. he was of a<br>
cautious and calculating disposition, and a natural inclination to save had been reinforced by the<br>

my mistress, bent anal, and it seems to me impossible that i should belong to the unclean say it out,<br>
said narda softly, and casting down her eyes. then she continued more excitedly: but i tell you, the<br>
curse is unjust, for a better man never lived than my grandfather was. tears sprang from her eyes, and<br>
rameri said: i fully believe it; and it must be very difficult to continue good when every one despises<br>
one; i at least can be brought to no good by blame, though i can by praise. certainly people are<br>
obliged to meet us and mine with respect. and as with contempt exclaimed uarda. but i will tell<br>
you something, if a man is sure that he is good, it is all the same to him whether he be despised<br>
or honored by other people. nay we may be prouder than you; for you great folks must often say to<br>
yourselves that you are worth less than we are worth i have seen you at, and we know that we are<br>
often thought that of you, exclaimed rameri, and there is one who recognizes your worth; and that is i.<br>
even if it were otherwise, i must always always think of you. i have thought of you too, said uarda.<br>
just now, when i was sitting with my sick grandmother, it passed through my mind how nice it would<br>
be if i had a brother just like you. do you know what i should do if you were my brother well i should<br>
buy you a chariot and horse, and you should go away to the kings war. you are so rich asked rameri<br>
smiling. oh yes answered uarda. to be sure, i have not been rich for more than an hour. you read<br>
him the garments and masks that he had lent the day before to hadrian and antinous. the sarmatian<br>
at the same time told him, with tears in his eyes, a sad, very sad story, which stirred the young<br>
sculptors soul deeply, and which would have prompted him to penetrate into the palace at once, at<br>
any risk, if he had not seen the necessity of being with papias at the appointed hour, which was<br>
drawing near, to answer for the valuable property that was missing, thinking of nothing, wishing<br>
nothing so much as to be back as promptly as possible at lochias, where he was much needed, and<br>
where his heart longed to be, he took the bundle out of the slaves hand and hurried away. papias had<br>
sent all his assistants and even his slaves off the premises; he received the breathless pollux quite<br>
alone, and took from him, with icy calmness, the things which had been borrowed from his property<br>
room, asking for them one by one. i have already told you, cried pollux, that it is not i, but the<br>
illustrious roman i do, who he is who is answerable for the silver quiver and the<br>
torn chiton. and he began to tell him how antinous had commanded him, in the name of his master, to<br>
find masks and disguises for them both. but papias cut off his speech at the very beginning, an</p>
