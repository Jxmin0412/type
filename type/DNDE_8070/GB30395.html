<p>idea; yet, if she tried to fly from him, all she loved would be lost. this must not be thought of she<br>
must remain. she threw herself on a divan, lost in thought, and as she realized the confidence of which<br>
the unapproachable, proud emperor had thought her worthy, a secret voice whispered to her that it was<br>
certainly a delightful thing to share the overwhelming agitations of the highest and greatest. and was<br>
he then really bad, he who felt the necessity of vindicating himself before a simple girl, and to whom it<br>
appeared so intolerable to be misjudged and condemned even by her besides being the emperor and a<br>
suffering man, caracalla had also become her wooer, it never once entered her mind to accept him; but<br>
still it flattered her extremely that the greatest of men should declare his love for her. why, then, need<br>
she fear him she was so important to him, she could do so much for him, that he would surely take<br>
care not to insult or offend her. this modest child, who till quite lately had trembled before her own<br>
fathers temper, now, in the consciousness of caesars favor, felt herself strong to triumph over the wrath<br>
and passions of the most powerful and most terrible of men. in the mean time she dared not risk<br>
confessing to him that she was anothers bride, for that might determine him to let diodoros feel his<br>
power. the thought that the emperor could care about her good opinion greatly pleased her; it even had<br>
the effect of raising the hope in her inexperienced mind that caracalla would moderate his passion for<br>
her sake when old adventus came into the room. he was in a hurry; for preparations had to be made in<br>
enthusiasm to the sound of lutes and pipes, and joining their voices in the chorus then light will shine<br>
once more on the world, then life will once more mean joy, and death a departure from a scene of bliss.<br>
aye, and thus shall it be cried olympius, fired by this eager exposition of his own excitement, and he<br>
wrung the musicians hand. we will restore life to the greeks and teach them to scorn death as of yore.<br>
let the christians, the barbarians, make life miserable and seek joy in death, if they list but the girls<br>
have ceased singing, there is still much to be done to day, and first of all i must confute the objections<br>
of your recalcitrant pupil. you will not find it an easy task, said karnis. reason is a feeble weapon in<br>
contending with a woman. not always, replied the philosopher. but you must know how to use it. leave<br>
me to deal with the child, there are really no singing women left here; we have tried three, but they<br>
were all sulyar and ill taught, this girl, when she sings with gorgo, has a voice that will go to the<br>
heart of the audience. what we want is to fire the crowd with enthusiasm, and she will help us to do it.<br>
well, well. but you, olympius, you who are the very soul of the revulsion we hope for, you must not be<br>
present at the festival. indeed, sheltered as you are under porphyrius roof, there is a price on your<br>
head, and this house swarms with slaves, who all know you; if one of them, tempted by filthy lucre<br>
they will not betray me, smiled the philosopher. they know that their aged mistress, damia, and i<br>
myself command the daemons of the upper and lower spheres, and that at a sign from her or from me<br>
and many other considerations, had been thrown into the scale. love out balanced them all; and,<br>
obedient to its impulse, she had resolved to fling all the rest behind her. it was nearing the hour of<br>
midnight, and the mansion of don ambrosio was dark and silent. its master was not at home. a grand<br>
banquet had been provided at the presidio by vizcarra and roblado, to which all the grandees of the<br>
settlement had been invited. don ambrosio was among the number. at this hour he was at the presidio,<br>
feasting and making merry, it was not a ladies festival, therefore catalina was not there, it was,<br>
indeed, rather an extemporised affair a sort of jubilee to wind up the performances of the day. the<br>
officers and priests were in high spirits, and had put their heads together in getting up the improvised<br>
banquet, the town had become silent, and the mansion of don ambrosio showed not a sign of life. the<br>
portero still lingered by the great gale, waiting his masters return; but he sat inside upon the<br>
banqueta of the zaguan, and seemed to be asleep. he was watched by those who wished him to sleep<br>
the large door of the caballeriza was open. within the framework of the posts and lintels the form<br>
of a man could be distinguished. it was the groom andres. there was no light in the stable. had there<br>
been so, four horses might have been seen standing in their stalls, saddled and bridled. a still stranger<br>
circumstance might have been observed around the hoofs of each horse were wrapped pieces of coarse</p>
