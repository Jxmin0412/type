done, every one applies himself to his calling, which is always one of the three afore mentioned, the<br>
hunters are again subdivided into two sorts; for some of these only hunt wild bulls and cows, others<br>
only wild boars. the first of these are called bucaniers, and not long ago were about six hundred on<br>
this island, but now they are reckoned about three hundred, the cause has been the great decrease of<br>
wild cattle, which has been such, that, far from getting, they are now but poor in their trade. when the<br>
bucaniers go into the woods to hunt for wild bulls and cons, they commonly remain there a<br>
twelvemonth or two years, without returning home. after the hunt is over, and the spoil divided, they<br>
commonly sail to tortuga, to provide themselves with guns, powder, and shot, and other necessaries for<br>
another expedition; the rest of their gains they spend prodigally, giving themselves to all manner of<br>
vices and debauchery, particularly to drunkenness, which they practise mostly with brandy: this they<br>
drink as liberally as the spaniards de water. sometimes they buy together a pipe of wine; this they<br>
stave at one end, and never cease drinking till it is out. thus cottishly they live till they have no<br>
money left. the said bucaniers are so very cruel and tyrannical to their servants, as that commonly they<br>
had rather be galley slaves, or saw brazil wood in the rasphouses of holland, than serve such<br>
barbarous masters. the second sort hunt nothing but wild boars; the flesh of these they salt, and sell it<br>
to the planters. these hunters have the same vicious customs, and are as much addicted to<br>
debauchery as the former, but their manner of hunting is different from that in europe; for these<br>
bucaniers have certain places designed for hunting, where they live for three or four months, and<br>
exception, asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if i had behaved sensibly then<br>
nothing more would have happened, everything that was waiting to happen would have been stifled.<br>
people are so often unprepared. in the bank, for example, i am so well prepared, nothing of this sort<br>
could possibly happen to me there, i have my own assistant there, there are telephones for internal and<br>
external calls in front of me on the desk, i continually receive visits from people, representatives,<br>
officials, but besides that, and most importantly, im always occupied with my work, thats to say im<br>
always alert, it would even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that sort. but<br>
now its over with, and i didnt really even want to talk about it any more, only i wanted to hear what<br>
you, a sensible woman, thought about it all, and im very glad to hear that were in agreement. but<br>
now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to be confirmed with a handshake.<br>
will she shake hands with me the supervisor didnt shake hands, he thought, and looked at the woman<br>
differently from before, examining her. she stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self<br>
conscious, she hadnt been able to understand everything that said. as a result of this self consciousness<br>
she said something that she certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate. dont take it so<br>
hard, she said, with tears in her voice and also, of course, forgetting the handshake. i didnt know i<br>
was taking it hard, said feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him it was<br>
of very little value. before going out the door he asked, is miss b√ºrstner home now mrs. grubach,<br>
add insult to the injury, we have suffered by your fault. a father whose daughter has been knocked<br>
down and hurt then, argus actually bit her cried antinous, horrified. no, keraunus replied. but as she<br>
fell her head and foot have been injured, and she is suffering much pain. that is very sad, said<br>
hadrian, and as i am not ignorant of the healing art, i will gladly try to help the poor girl. i pay a<br>
professional leech, who allends me and mine, replied the steward, in a repellant tone, and i came hither<br>
to request or, to be frank with you to require what first, that my pardon shall be asked, that, the<br>
artist, claudius venator, is always ready to do when any one has suffered damage by his fault. what<br>
has happened i repeat it grieves me sincerely, and i beg you tell the maiden to whom the accident<br>
happened, that her pain is mine. what more do you desire the stewards features had calmed down at<br>
these last words, and he answered with less excitement than before: i must request you to chain up<br>
your dog, or to shut it up, in some way to keep it from mischief. that is pretty strong cried the<br>
emperor. it is only a reasonable demand, and i must stand by it, replied keraunus decidedly, neither i</br>
