<p>the cardinal was fixed upon dalabers strenuous face. all weakness had vanished from it now. it was full<br>
of passionate earnestness and dauntless courage. his dark eyes met those of wolsey without fear or<br>
shrinking, the loftiness of a great resolve, a great sacrifice, was shining in them. i will consider this<br>
maller, my sons, spoke the cardinal, whose face softened as he gazed first at one young man and then<br>
at the other. i must communicate with the bishop, and i will see you again, fortunately he is not far<br>
from london. a messenger can quickly reach him. come to me here in four days time, and i will<br>
again and perchance give you an answer, will your mind have changed in those days, anthony dalaber<br>
do you indeed mean the things that you have said i do, he answered quietly, and added no<br>
protestations. i will remember, spoke the cardinal; and rising to his feet he gave to arthur the<br>
benediction for which he bent his knee. dalaber hesitated for a moment, and then he too knelt, there<br>
was no hypocrisy in this act. something in the aspect and the words of the cardinal had changed his<br>
opinion of the man during the brief interview. the lord bless thee, my son, spoke the priest solemnly.<br>
the lord give thee grace and discernment, wisdom and light. the lord strengthen all that is good in thee,<br>
that it may live and grow, and cast out and uproot all that may become a stumbling block or root of<br>
bitterness within thee. the lord give to thee the understanding mind, the childlike heart, the pure spirit<br>
of the children of light, and lead and guide thee into all truth. amen. the two companions went quietly<br>
from the room and through the long and stately passages, where the worldly pomp visible had stirred<br>
home to tell his mother of his success. when daubeny had first come to saint winifreds, he had been<br>
forced to go through very great persecution. as he sat down to do his work he would be pelled with<br>
orange peel, kicked, tilted off the form on which he sat, ridiculed, and sometimes chased out of the<br>
room. all this he had endured with admirable patience and good humour; in short, so patiently and<br>
good humouredly that all boys who had in them a spark of sense or honour very soon abandoned this<br>
system of torment, and made up for it as far as they could by respect and kindness, which always,<br>
however, took more or less the form of banter. it is not to be expected that boys will ever be made to<br>
see that steady, strenuous industry, even when it fails, is a greater and a better thing than idle<br>
cleverness, but those few who were so far in advance of their years as to have some intuition of this<br>
fact, felt for the character of daubeny, a value which gave him an influence of a rare and important<br>
kind. for nothing could daunt this young martyr not even failure itself. if he were too much bullied and<br>
annoyed to get up his lesson overnight, he would be up by five in the morning working at it with<br>
unremitting assiduity, very often he overdid it, and knew his lesson all the worse in proportion as he<br>
had spent upon it too great an amount of time. without being positively stupid, his intellect was<br>
somewhat dull, and as his manner was shy and awkward he had not been quite understood at first, and<br>
a master had taken him specially in hand to lighten his burdens. his bitterest trial, therefore, was to<br>
fail completely every now and then, and be reproached for it by some master who little knew the hours<br>
except the purple and white gertrude what on earth are you after the flowers, ted, the flowers in my<br>
dream there they are, a perfect carpet of them. white oh, how lovely and there, on the other side, are<br>
the purple ones. what are they, dear i know you are a good botanist. he always raved about your<br>
collection. nonsense, im nol a botanist. several other fellows went in for it when the prize was offered,<br>
and all that my collection was good for was his doing. i never did see any one arrange flowers as he<br>
did, i must say. every specimen was pressed so as somehow to keep its own way of growing, and when i<br>
did them, a columbine looked as stiff as a dog daisy. i never could keep any character in them. watson<br>
the fellow who drew so well made vignettes on the blank pages to lots of the specimens likely habitats<br>
we called them. he used to sit with his paint box in my window, and christian used to sit outside the<br>
window, on the edge, dangling his legs, and describing scenes out of his head for watson to draw.<br>
walson used to say, i wish i could paint with my brush as that fellow paints with his tongue and when<br>
the vignettes were admired, ive heard him say, in his dry way, i copied them from christians paintings;<br>
and the fellows used to stare, for you know he couldnt draw a line. and when but i say, gertrude, for</p>
