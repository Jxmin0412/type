but not to read it, only to seek some trace of the well known handwriting of her husband. like all the<br>
egyptian women of good family she could read, and during the first two years of her married life she<br>
had often very often had the opportunity of puzzling, and yet rejoicing, over the feeble signs which the<br>
iron hand of the charioteer had scrawled on the papyrus for her whose slender fingers could guide the<br>
reed pen with firmness and decision. she examined the letter, and at last said, with tears in her eyes:<br>
nothing i will go to my room, mother. katuti kissed her and said, hear first what your brother writes.<br>
but nefert shook her head, turned away in silence, and disappeared into the house. katuli was not very<br>
friendly to her son in law, but her heart clung to her handsome, reckless son, the very image of her<br>
lost husband, the favorite of women, and the gayest youth among the young nobles who composed the<br>
charist guard of the king, how fully he had written to day he who weilded the reed pen so laboriously.<br>
a this really was a letter; while, usually, he only asked in the fewest words for fresh funds for the<br>
gratification of his extravagant tastes. this time she might look for thanks, for not long since he must<br>
have received a considerable supply, which she had abstracted from the income of the possessions<br>
entrusted to her by her son in law. she began to read. the cheerfulness, with which she had met the<br>
dwarf, was insincere, and had resembled the brilliant colors of the rainbow, which gleam over the<br>
stagnant waters of a bog. a stone falls into the pool, the colors vanish, dim mists rise up, and it<br>
becomes foul and clouded, the news which her sons letter contained fell, indeed, like a block of stone on<br>
almost reduced to despair, they spied a great ship of the spanish flota, separated from the rest; this<br>
vessel they resolved to take, or die in the attempt. hereupon, they sailed towards her, to view her<br>
strength. and though they judged the vessel to be superior to theirs, yet their covelousness, and the<br>
extremity they were reduced to, made them venture. being come so near that they could not possibly<br>
escape, they made an oath to their captain, pierre le grand, to stand by him to the last. tis true, the<br>
pirates did believe they should find the ship unprovided to fight, and thereby the sooner master her, it<br>
was in the dusk of the evening they began to attack; but before they engaged, they ordered the<br>
surgeon of the boat to bore a hole in the sides of it, that their own vessel sinking under them, they<br>
might be compelled to attack more vigorously, and endeavour more hastily to board the ship. this was<br>
done accordingly, and without any other arms than a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other, they<br>
immediately climbed up the sides of the ship, and ran altogether into the great cabin, where they found<br>
the captain, with several of his companions, playing at cards. here they set a pistol to his breast,<br>
commanding him to deliver up the ship. the spaniards, surprised to see the pirates on board their ship,<br>
cried jesus bless me. what devils are these meanwhile some of them took possession of the gun room,<br>
and seized the arms, killing as many as made any opposition; whereupon the spaniards<br>
presently surrendered. that very day the captain of the ship had been told by some of the seamen<br>
the boat which was in view, cuising, was a boat of pirates; whom the captain slightly answered, what<br>
then, must i be afraid of such a pitiful thing as that is no, though she were a ship as big and as<br>
tiny is. i want her to drive to the other end of the parish with me. there she is, said his wife,<br>
looking out of the window, by the garden gale, with a great basket; what has she been after the rector<br>
went out to discover, and met his daughter looking decidedly earthy, and seemingly much exhausted by<br>
the weight of a basketful of groundsel plants. where have you been said he. in the doctors garden, said<br>
tiny triumphantly; and look what i have done ive weeded his sweet peas, and brought away the<br>
groundsel; so when he gets home to night hell think a brownie has been in the garden, for mrs. pickles<br>
has promised not to tell him. but look here said the rector, affecting a great appearance of severity,<br>
youre my brownie, not his. supposing tommy trout had gone and weeded farmer swedes garden, and<br>
brought back his weeds to go to seed on the tailors flower beds, how do you think he would have liked<br>
it tiny looked rather crestfallen. when one has fairly carried through a splendid benevolence of this<br>
kind, it is trying to find oneself in the wrong, she crept up to the rector, however, and put her golden<br>
head upon his arm. but, father dear, she pleaded, i didnt mean not to be your brownie; only, you</p>
