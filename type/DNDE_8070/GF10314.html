their counterfeit cannon, laying under every piece many pounds of powder; besides, they cut down many<br>
cutworks of the ship, that the powder might exert its strength the better; breaking open, also, neve port<br>
holes, where, instead of guns, they placed little drums used by the negroes. finally, the decks were<br>
handsomely beset with many pieces of wood, dressed up like men with hats, or monteras, and armed<br>
with swords, muskets, and bandeleers. the fire ship being thus fitted, they prepared to go to the entry<br>
of the port. all the prisoners were put into one great boat, and in another of the biggest they placed<br>
all the women, plate, jewels, and other rich things: into others they put the bales of goods and<br>
merchandise, and other things of bulk: each of these boats had twelve men aboard, very well armed; the<br>
brilot had orders to go before the rest of the vessels, and presently to fall foul with the great ship. all<br>
things being ready, captain morgan exacted an oath of all his comrades, protesting to defend<br>
themselves to the last drop of blood, without demanding quarter; promising withal, that whosoever<br>
behaved himself thus, should be very well rewarded. with this courageous resolution they set sail to<br>
seek the spaniards. on april,, they found the spanish fleet riding at anchor in the middle of the entry<br>
of the lake. captain morgan, it being now late and almost dark, commanded all his vessels to an<br>
anchor, designing to fight even all night if they forced him to it. he ordered a careful watch to be kept<br>
solid for his meals, crept up a reed and sunned his wings; the water gnals skimmed and<br>
skated about, measuring the surface of the water with their long legs; the boatmen shot up and down<br>
till one was quite giddy, showing the white on their bodies, like swallows wheeling for their autumn<br>
flight. even the water scorpion moved slowly over a sunny place from the roots of an arrow head lily to<br>
a dark corner under the duck weed. molly shouted the boy; i wish youd come and give a pull at the<br>
water soldier. ive nearly got him up but the leaves cut my hands, and youve got gloves. if the colander<br>
is ready, ill begin to fish. theres a beetle on that stick. i wish i were near enough, i could snatch him<br>
like anything. i wouldnt advise you to, said molly, grandfather says that water beetles have got<br>
daggers in their tails. besides, some of the beetles are very greedy and eat the fish. the big black one<br>
doesnt, said francis. he said so. hydrous piceus is the name, and i dare say thats the one. ils the<br>
biggest of all the water beetles and very harmless. he may be a good one, said molly, looking<br>
thoughtfully and unmistakably at me, or he may be one of the bad ones; and if he is, hell eat<br>
everything before him. but by this time francis was dipping the colander in and out on the opposite<br>
side, and she was left to struggle with the water soldier. hes up at last, she announced, and the soldier<br>
was landed on the bank. come round, said the boy; ive filled three jars. i hope you've been careful,<br>
francis. you know grandfather says that to stock a fresh water aquarium is like the puzzle of the fox<br>
the conqueror, that he had been at last carried fainting to the tent which he shared with the high<br>
priest, and which was not far from that of the regent. he found the old man much revived, and was<br>
preparing to mount his chariot to go to the banquet, when the regents myrmidons led pentaur past in<br>
front of him. ameni looked doubtfully at the tall and noble figure of the prisoner, but pentaur<br>
recognized him, called him by his name, and in a moment they stood together, hand clasped in hand.<br>
the guards showed some uneasiness, but ameni explained who he was. the high priest was sincerely<br>
rejoiced at the preservation and restoration of his favorite disciple, whom for many months he had<br>
mourned as dead; he looked at his manly figure with fatherly tenderness, and desired the guards, who<br>
bowed to his superior dignity, to conduct his friend, on his responsibility; to his tent instead of to anis.<br>
there pentaur found his old friend gagabu, who wept with delight at his safety. all that his master had<br>
accused him of seemed to be forgotten. ameni had him clothed in a fresh white robe, he was never tired<br>
of looking at him, and over and over again clapped his hand upon his shoulder, as if he were his own<br>
son that had been lost and found again. pentaur was at once required to relate all that had happened<br>
to him, and the poet told the story of his captivity and liberation at mount sinai, his meeting with<br>
bent anat, and how he had fought in the battle of kadesh, had been wounded by an arrow, and found<br>
and rescued by the faithful kaschta. he concealed only his passion for bent anat, and the fact that he</p>
