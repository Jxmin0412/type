painted wainscoting, a huge four post bed with yellow curtains, and a pretty view from the windows. in<br>
the middle of the floor we saw our box standing in all its dignity, uncorded, and ready, then it was the<br>
terrible fact broke upon our minds that the key was left behind. my sufferings during the few seconds<br>
before i found courage to confide this misfortune to my new friend were considerable. when i did tell<br>
her, the calmness and good nature with which she received the confession were both surprising and<br>
delightful. the lock doesnt look a very uncommon one, she said, as she opened the door. i dare say i<br>
may find a key to fit it. whats the matter said a voice outside. it was the irish gentleman. she<br>
explained. keys said the irish gentleman; got lots in my pocket, besides their being totally<br>
unnecessary, as im a capital hand at lock picking, let me see. with which he slipped in, seeming quite<br>
as much at his ease as in the drawing room, and in another second had squattled upon the floor before<br>
our box, where he seemed to be quite as comfortable as in the arm chair he had left. here he poked,<br>
and fitted, and whistled, and chatted without a pause. ive locks and keys to everything i possess he<br>
cheerfully remarked; and as i never lock up anything, theres no damage done if the keys are left<br>
behind, which is a good thing, you see, as i always leave everything everywhere. do you make a<br>
principle of it asked the young lady, coldly. im afraid i make a practice of it. he had opened the box,<br>
and was leaning against the bed post, with a roguish twinkle in his brown eyes, which faded, however,<br>
under the silent severity of the red haired young lady, and gave place to a look of melancholy that<br>
might have melted granite, as he added: im all alone, you see, thats what does it. i believe in the<br>
skill and his own strength. and it had wounded her when occasionally her brother in law had suggested<br>
economy, and had reminded her, in his straightforward way, of her narrow means, and the uncertain<br>
future of her children. at this she was deeply offended, for she ventured to say that her relatives could<br>
never, with all their gifts, compensate for the insults they heaped upon her; and thus taught them by<br>
experience that we quarrel with no one more readily than with the benefactor whom we can never repay<br>
for all the good he bestows on us. nevertheless, when her brother in law asked the hand of her<br>
daughter for his son, she willingly gave her consent. nefert and paaker had grown up together, and by<br>
this union che foresaw that she could secure her own future and that of her children. shortly after the<br>
death of the mohar, the charioteer one had proposed for neferts hand, but would have been refused if<br>
the king himself had not supported the suit of his favorite officer. after the wedding, she retired with<br>
nefert to our house, and undertook, while he was at the war, to manage his great estates, which<br>
however had been greatly burthened with debt by his father. fate put the menas into her hands of<br>
indemnifying herself and her children for many past privations, and she availed herself of them to<br>
gratify her innate desire to be esteemed and admired; to obtain admission for her son, splendidly<br>
equipped, inlo a company of chariot warriors of the highest class; and to surround her daughter with<br>
princely magnificence. when the regent, who had been a friend of her late husband, removed into the<br>
palace of the pharaohs, he made her advances, and the clever and decided woman knew how to make<br>
of isis, charmian returned to lochias earlier than she herself had expected. she had met her brother,<br>
whom she did not find at kanopus, at berenikes, and after greeting dion on his couch of pain, she told<br>
archibius of her anxiety. she confided to him alone that the queen had committed barines fate to<br>
alexas, for the news might easily have led the mother of the endangered woman to some desperate<br>
venture; but even archibiuss composure, so difficult to disturb, was not proof against it. he would have<br>
sought the queens presence at once if necessary, forced his way to it; but the historian timagenes, who<br>
had just come from rome, was expecting him, and he had not returned to his birthplace as a privale<br>
citizen, but commissioned by octavianus to act as mediator in putting an end to the struggle which had<br>
really been decided in his favour at the battle of actium, the choice of this mediator was a happy one;<br>
for he had taught cleopatra in her childhood, and was the self same quick wilted man who had so<br>
often roused her to argument. his share in a popular insurrection against the roman rule had led to<br>
his being carried as a slave to the tiber, there he soon purchased his freedom, and attained such</p>
