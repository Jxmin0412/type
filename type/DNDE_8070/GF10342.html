this i had frequently quitted it full of deep contempt, for among the imprisoned christians, there were<br>
too often lazy vagabonds, who had loudly confessed the saviour only to be fed by the gifts of the<br>
brethren; there i had seen accursed criminals, who hoped by a martyrs death to win back the<br>
redemption that they had forfeited; there i had heard the woeful cries of the faint hearted, who feared<br>
death as much as they feared treason to the most high. there were things to be seen there that might<br>
harrow the soul, but also examples of the sublimest greatness. men have i seen there, aye, and women,<br>
who went to their death in calm and silent bliss, and whose end was, indeed, more noble than<br>
that of the much lauded codrus or decius mus. to woman drew me among all the prisoners there was neither man nor<br>
woman who was more calmly self possessed, more devoutly resigned, than magdalen. the words, there is<br>
more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine that need no repentance,<br>
strengthened her greatly, and she repented yea and verily, she did. and for my part, yod is my witness<br>
that not an impulse as from man to woman drew me to her, and yet i could not leave her, and i passed<br>
the day by her side, and at night she haunted my soul, and it would have seemed to me fairer than all<br>
in life besides to have been allowed to die with her. it was at the time of the fourth decree of<br>
persecution, a few months before the promulgation of the first edict of toleration. he that sacrifices, it<br>
is said, shall go unpunished, and he that refuses, shall by some means or other be brought to it, but<br>
those who continue stiff necked shall suffer death. for a long time much consideration had been shown<br>
reserve the sanctuary for the wedding of the fugitives for a short time after the departure of the<br>
procession, which was to take place at sunset. in return for this service another might perhaps soon be<br>
requested from the friend of octavianus, who greeted his promise with grateful warmth. the priesthood,<br>
said serapion, takes sides with all who are unjustly persecuted, and in this case bestows aid the<br>
willingly on account of its great anxiety to guard the queen from an act which would be difficult to<br>
approve. as for the fugitives, so far as he could see, only two possibilities were open to them: cleopatra<br>
would cleave to mark antony and go would that the immortals might avert it to ruin, or she would<br>
sacrifice him and save her throne and life. in both cases the endangered lovers could return<br>
uninjured the queen had a merciful heart, and never retained anger long if no guilt existed. the details<br>
of the plan were then settled by archibius, anukis, and berenike, who was with the family of arius, and<br>
the decision was communicated to the architect, archibius had maintained the same silence concerning<br>
the destination of the fugitives towards the men composing the council and barines mother as to his<br>
sister. with regard to the mission of timagenes and the political questions which occupied his mind, he<br>
gave charmian only the degree of information necessary to explain the plan she so lovingly promoted;<br>
but she had no desire to know more. on the way home her mind was wholly absorbed by the fear that<br>
cleopatra had missed her services and discovered barines flight. true, she mentioned the queens desire to<br>
place her children in archibiuss charge, but she could not give him full particulars until she reached<br>
her own apartments. her absence had not been noticed. the regent mardion had received the procession<br>
her down to a secure footing on the plateau. so long as she followed him unresistingly he led her<br>
towards the mountain without aim or fixed destination but away, away from the abyss. she paused by<br>
a square block of diorite, and paulus, who had not failed to observe how heavy her steps were, desired<br>
her to sit down; he pushed up a flag of stone, which he propped with smaller ones, so that sirona<br>
might not lack a support for her weary back. when he had accomplished this, sirona leaned back<br>
against the stone, and something of dawning satisfaction was audible in the soft sigh, which was the<br>
first sound that had escaped her tightly closed lips since her rescue. paulus smiled at her<br>
encouragingly, and said, now rest a little, i see what you want; one cannot defy the heat of the sun<br>
for a whole day with impunity. sirona nodded, pointed to her mouth, and implored wearily and very softly<br>
for water, a little water. paulus struck his hand against his forehead, and cried eagerly, directly i will<br>
bring you a fresh draught. in a few minutes i will be back again. sirona looked after him as he<br>
hastened away. her gaze became more and more staring and glazed, and she felt as if the rock, on<br>
