said that ameni was going to send him to the quarries at chennu, but that that was much too small a<br>
punishment. then hekt advised him to give a secret commission to the captain of the ship to go beyond<br>
chennu, to the frightful mountain mines, of which she has often told me, for her father and her brother<br>
were tormented to death there. none ever return from thence, said the prince, but what came<br>
next, i only half understood, but they spoke of some drink that makes people mad. oh what shall i<br>
hear i would he contentedly on my board all my life long, but all else is too horrible i wish that i were<br>
dead. and the child began to cry bitterly, uarda, whose cheeks had turned pale, patted him<br>
affectionately; but rameri exclaimed: it is frightful unheard of but who was the steward did you not<br>
hear his name collect yourself, little man, and stop crying, it is a case of life and death. who was the<br>
scoundrel did she not name him try to remember. scherau bit his red lips, and tried for composure. his<br>
tears ceased, and suddenly he exclaimed, as he put his hand into the breast of his ragged little<br>
garment: stay, perhaps you will know him again i made him you did what asked the prince. i made<br>
him, repeated the little artist, and he carefully brought out an object wrapped up in a scrap of rag, i<br>
could just see his head quite clearly from one side all the time he was speaking, and my clay lay by<br>
me. i always must model something when my mind is excited, and this time i quickly made his face,<br>
and the image was successful, i kept it about me to show to the master when hekt was out, while he<br>
spoke he had carefully unwrapped the figure with trembling fingers, and had given it to uarda. ani<br>
handkerchiefs to hem, said he, laughing to himself. nothing else to wish for; nothing to cry about.<br>
nevertheless, he lay still, staring at the sky, till the smile died away, and tears came into his eyes.<br>
fortunately, no one was there to see what could this awfully jolly doctor be thinking of to make him<br>
cry he was thinking of a grave stone in the churchyard close by, and of a story connected with this<br>
grave stone which was known to everybody in the place who was old enough to remember it. this story<br>
has nothing to do with the present story, so it ought not to be told, and yet it has to do with the<br>
doctor, and is very short, so it shall be put in, after all. the story of a grave stone. one early spring<br>
morning, about twenty years before, a man going to his work at sunrise through the churchyard,<br>
stopped by a flat stone which he had lately helped to lay down. the day before, a name had been cut<br>
on it, which he stayed to read; and below the name some one had scrawled a few words in pencil, which<br>
he read also pitifully behold the sonors of our hearts. on the stone lay a pencil, and a few feet from it<br>
lay the doctor, face downwards, so he had lain all night, with the hoar frost on his black hair, ah<br>
these grave stones they were ugly things in those days; not the light, hopeful, pretty crosses we set up<br>
now, how they seem remorselessly to imprison and keep our dear dead friends away from us and yet<br>
they do not lie with a feathers weight upon the souls that are gone, while god only knows how heavily<br>
they press upon the souls that are left behind. did the spirit whose body was with the dead, stand that<br>
morning by the body whose spirit was with the dead, and pity him let us only talk about what we<br>
see that many headed monster, the people, you must, but i entreat. the others the first considerations are<br>
enough; but may i be permitted to know what my wise friend has awarded to the hapless wight from<br>
whom she withdrew her favour first, imprisonment here at lochias. he has stained his hands with the<br>
blood of caesarion, the king of kings. that is high treason, even in the eyes of the people. try to<br>
obtain the order for the arrest this very day, whenever i can disturb the queen with such matters, not<br>
for nay sake, but to save her from injury. away with everything which can cloud her intellect in these<br>
decisive days first, away with barine, who spoiled her return home; and then let us take care of the<br>
man who would be capable, for this womans sake, of causing an insurrection in alexandria, the great<br>
associated with the state and the throne are hers; for the minor ones of the toilet and the heart i<br>
will provide. here she was interrupted by one of cleopatras waiting maids. the queen had awakened, and<br>
iras hastened to her post. as she passed charmians apartments and saw two handsome soldiers,<br>
belonging to the macedonian body guard, pacing to and fro on duty before them, her face darkened. it<br>
was against her alone that charmian was protecting barine. she had been harshly reproved by the older</p>
