appearance of innocence and industry so continually displayed by these people, when i was called upon<br>
to witness a sight which exhibited their character in its worst light, and confirmed all my<br>
suspicions regarding their alleged cannibalism. the new zealanders have been long charged with<br>
cannibalism; but as no person of importance or celebrity had actually been a witness to the disgusting<br>
act, in pily to our nature such relations have been universally rejected, and much has been written to<br>
prove the non existence of so hideous a propensity. it was my lot to behold it in all its horrors on<br>
a morning, about eleven oclock, after i had just returned from a long walk, captain duke informed me he<br>
had heard, from very good authority though the natives wished it to be kept a profound secret, that in<br>
the adjoining village a female slave, named matowe, had been put to death, and that the people were<br>
at that very time preparing her flesh for cooking, at the same time he reminded me of a circumstance<br>
which had taken place the evening before. aloi had been paying us a visit, and, when going away, he<br>
recognised a girl whom he said was a slave that had run away from him; he immediately seized hold of<br>
her, and gave her in charge to some of his people. the girl had been employed in carrying wood for us;<br>
atois laying claim to her had caused us no alarm for her life, and we had thought no more on the<br>
subject; but now, to my surprise and horror, i heard this poor girl was the victim they were preparing<br>
for the oven captain duke and myself were resolved to witness this dreadful scene. we therefore kept our<br>
information as secret as possible, well knowing that if we had manifested our wishes they would have<br>
and judgment was immediately pronounced against him, on the strength of his masters accusation and<br>
his own admissions. it would have been sheer waste of time to listen to the romances with which this<br>
andacious rascal who forgot all the respect he owed to his teacher and benefactor wanted to cram the<br>
judges. two years of reflection, the protectors of the law deemed, might suffice to teach this dangerous<br>
fellow to respect the property of others and to keep him from outbreaks against those to whom he owed<br>
gratitude and reverence. pollux, safe in the prison at canopus, cursed his destiny and indulged in vain<br>
hopes of the assistance of his friends. these were at last weary of the vain search and only asked about<br>
him occasionally. he at first was so insubordinate under restraint that he was put under close ward<br>
from which he was not released until, instead of raging with fury he dreamed away his days in sullen<br>
brooding, the gaoler knew one well, and he thought he could safely predict that at the end of his two<br>
years imprisonment this young thief would quit his cell a harmless imbecile. titianus, pontius, balbilla<br>
and even antinous had all attempted to speak of him to the emperor, but each was sharply repulsed<br>
and taught that hadrian was little inclined to pardon a wound to his artists sanity. but the sovereign<br>
also proved that he had a good memory for benefits he had received, for once, when a dish was set<br>
before him consisting of cabbage and small sausages he smiled, and taking out his purse filled with<br>
gold pieces, he ordered a chamberlain to take it in his name to doris, the wife of the evicted gate<br>
comfortable with the widow, the ground had long burnt under his feet, and the money in his pocket, he<br>
was now possessed of ample means to acquire a good new slave, perhaps, if he threw old sebek into the<br>
bargain, they might even suffice to procure him a handsome greek, who might teach the children to<br>
read and write. he could direct his first attention to the external appearance of the new member of his<br>
household, if he were a scholar as well, he would feel justified in the high price he expected to be<br>
obliged to pay for him. ua keraunus approached the slave market he said, not without some<br>
emotion at his own paternal devotion: all for the credit of the house, all, and only, for the children.<br>
arsinoe carried out her intention of staying with selene; her father was to fetch her on his way home.<br>
after he was gone, hannah and mary left the two sisters together, for they supposed that they must<br>
wish to discuss a variety of things without the presence of strangers. as soon as the girls were alone<br>
arsinoe began: your cheeks are rosy, selene, and you look cheerful ah and i, i am so happy so happy<br>
because you are to fill the part of roxana that is very nice loo, and who would have thought only<br>
yesterday morning that we should be so rich today, we hardly know what to do with all the money.<br>
yes, for father has sold two objects out of his collection for six thousand drachmae. oh cried selene</p>
