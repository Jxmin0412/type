in english, half yellow men; these they ordered with iron tools to dig a way through the rocks, this<br>
they performed with the greatest speed imaginable; and through this way, by the help of many ropes<br>
and pulleys, they at last made shift to get up two pieces of ordnance, wherewith they made a battery<br>
next day, to play on the fort. meanwhile, the french knowing these designs, prepared for a defence<br>
while the spaniards were busy about the battery sending notice everywhere to their companions for<br>
help, thus the hunters of the island all joined together, and with them all the pirates who were not<br>
already too far from home. these landed by night at tortuga, lest they should be seen by the<br>
spaniards; and, under the same obscurity of the night, they all together, by a back way, climbed the<br>
mountain where the spaniards were posted, which they did the more easily being acquainted with these<br>
rocks, they came up at the very instant that the spaniards, who were above, were preparing to shoot at<br>
the fort, not knowing in the least of their coming, here they set upon them at their backs with such<br>
fury as forced the greatest part to precipitate themselves from the top to the bottom, and dash their<br>
bodies in pieces: few or none escaped; for if any remained alive, they were put to the sword. some<br>
spaniards did still keep the bottom of the mountain; but these, hearing the shrieks and cries of them<br>
that were killed, and believing some tragical revolution to be above, fled immediately towards the sea,<br>
despairing ever to regain the island of tortuga. the governors of this island behaved themselves as<br>
proprietors and absolute lords thereof till, when the west india company of france took possession<br>
thereof, and sent thither, for their governor, monsieur ogeron. these planted the colony for themselves<br>
neglect of more important considerations, such as odd corners for hide and seek, deep window seals,<br>
plenty of cupboards, and a garden adapted to the construction of bowers rather than to the cultivation<br>
of vegetables. i do not think my hopes of influencing the parental decision were great; but still we<br>
felt that it was well that i should be there, and my importance swelled with every piece of advice i<br>
received from the rest of the party, it must be a big house, but, of course, that adds to the expense,<br>
said one of the older boys, who prided himself upon being more grown up in his views than the rest,<br>
and considering the question from an elderly point of view. but if you dont take it out one way, you<br>
have it another, he continued. a manly sounding sentence, which impressed us all. dont think about<br>
smartness, mary, he went on, with a grand air of renouncing vanities; fine entrance, you know, and<br>
a good back yard, if possible, and some empty outhouses for carpenters shops; and if<br>
you could meet with a place with a few old boxes and barrels lying about, for rafts on the river and so<br>
forth, it would be a good thing. i want a tidy box for a new baby house, dreadfully, added a sisler. i<br>
hope therell be deep window places, sighed the luxurious fatima, with print patchwork cushions, like<br>
those at the farm. and i hope some of them will face west, for the sunsets. above all and it was the<br>
final and most impressive change i received whatever else is wanting, let us have two tall trees for a<br>
swing. laden with responsibility, but otherwise light hearted enough, i set out with my parents by the<br>
early coach, which was to put us down about mid day in the little town by the river. i liked travelling<br>
did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and this would also give him the chance<br>
to find out when miss bürstner would arrive home. perhaps it would also still be possible, even if a<br>
little inappropriate, to have a few words with her. as he lay there by the window, pressing his hands to<br>
his tired eyes, he even thought for a moment that he mite punish mrs. grubach by persuading miss<br>
bürstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would. but he immediately realised that that<br>
would be shockingly excessive, and there would also be the suspicion that he was moving house because<br>
of the incidents of that morning, nothing would have been more nonsensical and, above all, more<br>
pointless and contemptible. when he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he slightly<br>
opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone who entered the flat from where he was<br>
and lay down on the couch. he lay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven oclock. he wasnt<br>
able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the hallway as if in that way he could<br>
make miss bürstner arrive sooner. he had no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what<br>
