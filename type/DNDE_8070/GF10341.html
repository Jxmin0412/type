and they displayed a great deal of courage and address in approaching and securing them. the pirates<br>
having many passengers and others in their power stipulated that they should be landed at kororarika,<br>
unmolested by any of the english. this was granted; but no sooner were they left by themselves than a<br>
party of natives came forward, seized and bound them, stripped off their clothes, and, after dressing<br>
themselves up in them, conducted their prisoners on board the whalers; but notwithstanding the anxiety<br>
of the whalers to secure the whole, and the activity of the natives, six of them found means to elude the<br>
search, and here they now are. the day on which our houses were burned, these six landed in the train<br>
of one of the chiefs; and i have since entertained a suspicion that it was their desire of revenge that<br>
occasioned the destruction of our property at the time the calamity happened. i chanced to be in the<br>
house alone, and was amazed by seeing an englishman enter the hut with his face tattooed all over.<br>
not being aware he was one of the runaways from the wellington, i spoke to him. he slunk into a<br>
cooking house on pretence of lighting his pipe, and before ten minutes had elapsed, the house was in<br>
flames. chapter xxxi. the climate and productions. the summer was now far advanced, and never, during<br>
ils progress, had we been incommoded by any very hot weather. our house was generally crowded with<br>
visitors: for, as it was the workmanship of king george and his people, they were prodigiously proud of<br>
it, and each seemed to think he had an undoubted right to sit in il as much as he liked this, at times,<br>
we felt as a great annoyance, but we were obliged to be very cautious not to say or do anything that<br>
they had lived there for ten years unmolested and at peace; who would care to molest them now and yet<br>
humphrey, who knew the forest so well its mysterious, interminable depths, its trackless, boundless<br>
extent, rolling over hill and valley in endless billows he knew well how silently, how suddenly an<br>
ambushed foe might approach, spring out from the thick, tangled shelter to do some murderous deед,<br>
and in the maze of giant timber be at once swallowed up beyond all danger of pursuit. in the open<br>
plains the indian raids were terrible enough, but the horrors of uncertainty and ignorance which<br>
enveloped the settlers in the forests might well cause the stoutest heart to quail when it became<br>
known that the indians had become their enemies, and that there was another enemy stirring up the<br>
strife, and bribing the fierce and greedy savages to carry desolation and death into the settlements of<br>
the english colonists. whispers rumours had just begun to penetrate into these leafy solitudes; but<br>
communication with the outside world was so rare that the angell family, who had long been self<br>
supporting, and able to live without the products of the mother colony away to the east, had scarcely<br>
realized the change that was creeping over the country. the old man had never seen anything of indian<br>
warfare, and his sons had had little more experience. they had been peaceful denizens of the woods, and<br>
bore arms for purposes of the chase rather than for self preservation from human foes, as did the bulk<br>
of those dwellers in the woods that fringed the western border of the english speaking colony, we have<br>
no enemies; why should we fear asked charles, the elder brother, a man of placable temperament, a fine<br>
worker with the axe or plough, a man of indomitable industry, endurance, and patience, but who<br>

shine as he goes round. he was also a bit of a dabbler at poetry, a writer of songs, epigrams,<br>
epitaphs, c.; and having been a long resident in the east, was thought to be a very useful guide on<br>
such an excursion, and proved himself a very pleasant sort of companion: he had a dawning pleasantry<br>
in his countenance, eradiated by an eye of vivacity, which seemed to indicate there was nothing which<br>
gave him so much gratification as a mirth moving jest. what spirits were his, what wit and what whim,<br>
now cracking a joke, and now breaking a limb. give him but food for laughter, and he would almost<br>
consider himself furnished with food and raiment. there was however a pedantic manner with him at<br>
times; an affectation of the clerical in his dress, which, upon the whole, did not appear to be of the<br>
newest fashion, or improved by wearing; yet he would not barter one wakeful jest for a hundred sleepy<br>
sermons, or one laugh for a thousand sighs. if he ever sighd at all, it was because he had been serious<br>
where he might have laughd; if he had ever wept, it was because mankind had not laughd more and<br>
