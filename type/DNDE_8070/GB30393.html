<p>good the whole afternoon, said his mother setchem. she sees you so seldom. may be, replied paaker;<br>
still i know this the doys love me, but no child will come to me. you have such hard hands. take the<br>
squalling brat away, said paaker to the nurse. mother, i want to speak to you. setchem quieted the<br>
child, gave it many kisses, and sent it to bed; then she went up to her son stroked his cheeks, and<br>
said: if the little one were your own, she would go to you at once, and teach you that a child is the<br>
greatest blessing which the gods bestow on us mortals. paaker smiled and said: i know what you are<br>
aiming at but leave it for the present, for i have something important to communicate to you. well<br>
asked setchem. to day for the first time since you know when, i have spoken to nefert. the past may be<br>
forgotten. you lony for your sister; go to her, i have nothing more to say against it. setchem looked at<br>
her son with undisguised astonishment; her eyes which easily filled with tears, now overflowed, and she<br>
hesitatingly asked: can i believe my ears; child, have you i have a wish, said paaker firmly, that you<br>
should knit once more the old ties of affection with your relations; the estrangement has lasted long<br>
enough. much too long cried setchem. the pioneer looked in silence at the ground, and obeyed his<br>
mothers sign to sit down beside her. i knew, she said, taking his hand, that this day would bring us<br>
joy; for i dreamt of your father in osiris, and when i was being carried to the temple, i was met, first<br>
by a white cow, and then by a wedding procession. the white ram of anion, too, touched the wheat<br>
cakes that i offered him. it boded death to germanicus when the apis refused to eat out of his hand.<br>
floor, and tumbling clumsily up the uncarpeted, creaking stairs. in other churches the members of the<br>
congregation seated themselves in their pers upon their arrival, but rose reverently when the parson,<br>
dressed in black skull cap and geneva cloak, entered the door, and they stood, in token of respect, until<br>
after he entered the pulpit and was seated. it was also the honor giving and deferential custom in many<br>
new england churches, in the eighteenth century, for the entire congregation to remain respectfully<br>
standing within the pens at the end of the serice until the minister had descended from his lofty pulpit,<br>
opened the door of his wifes pew, and led her with stately dignity to the church porch, where, were he<br>
and she genial and neighborly minded souls, they in turn stood and greeted with carefully adjusted<br>
degrees of warmth, interest, respect, or patronage, the different members of the congregation as they<br>
slowly passed out. iv. the old fashioned pews. in the early new england meeting houses the seats were<br>
long, narrow, uncomfortable benches, which were made of simple, rough, hand riven planks placed on<br>
legs like milking stools. they were without any support or rest for the back; and perhaps the stiff<br>
backed pilgrims and puritans required or wished no support. quickly, as the colonies grew in wealth<br>
and the colonists in ambition and importance, spots for pues were sold or pitts as they were sometimes<br>
called, at first to some fer rich or influential men who wished to sit in a group together, and finally<br>
each family of dignity or wealth sat in its own family pew. often it was stipulated in the permission to<br>
build a pew that a separate entrance door should be cut into it through the outside wall of the meeting<br>
house, thus detracting grievously from the external symmetry of the edifice, but obviating the necessity<br>
sunday, and the people were just coming out of the church, when a horseman, covered with sweat and<br>
dust, galloped into the plaza, his habiliments were those of a sergeant of dragoons; and all easily<br>
recognised the well known lineaments of the sergeant gomez. in a few minutes he was surrounded by a<br>
crowd of idlers, who, although it was sunday, were heard a few moments after breaking out into loud<br>
acclamations of joy, hats were uptossed and vivas rent the air what news had gomez announced a<br>
bit of news the capture of the outlaw it was true. carlos had been taken, and was now a prisoner in the<br>
hands of the soldiers. he had been captured neither by strength nor stratagem. treachery had done the<br>
work. he had been betrayed by one of his own people. it was thus his capture had been effected.<br>
despairing for the present of being able to communicate with catalina, he had formed the resolution to<br>
remove his mother and sister from the valley. he had prepared a temporary home for them far off in<br>
the wilderness, where they would be secure from his enemies, while he himself could return at a better<br>
opportunity. to effect their removal, watched as they were, he knew would be no easy matter. but he</p>
