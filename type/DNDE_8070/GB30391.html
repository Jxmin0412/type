<p>forbidden to come to see us and to play with me. that has spoilt many pleasant hours for me, too. it<br>
was nice when we used to dress up in my fathers theatrical finery and cloaks. and when you made us<br>
dolls out of clay.. or when we performed the olympian games. i was always the teacher when we played<br>
at school with our little brothers and sisters. arsince gave you most trouble. oh and what fun when we<br>
went fishing and when we brought home the fishes and mother gave us meal and raisins to cook them.<br>
do you remember the festival of adonis, and how i stopped the runaway horse of that numidian officer<br>
the horse had knocked over arsinoe, and when we got home mother gave you an almond cake, and your<br>
ungrateful sister bit a great piece out of it and left me only a tiny morsel. is arsince as pretty as she<br>
promised to become it is two years since i last saw her; at our place we never have time to leave work<br>
till it is dark. for eight months i had to work for the master at ptolemais, and often saw the old folks<br>
but once in the month. we go out very little, too, and we are not allowed to go into your parents<br>
house. my sister is she pretty yes, i think she is. whenever she can get hold of a piece of ribbon she<br>
plaits it in her hair, and the men in the street turn round to look at her, she is sixteen now. sixteen<br>
what, little arsinoe why, how long then is it since your mother died four years and eight months. you<br>
remember the date very exactly; such a mother is not easily forgotten, indeed. she was a good woman<br>
and a kinder i never met. i know, too, that she tried to mollify your fathers feeling, but she could not<br>
succeed, and then she need must die yes, said selene gloomily. how could the gods decree it they are<br>
often more cruel than the hardest hearted man. your poor little brothers and sisters the girl bowed her<br>
himself was startled for the moment, and looked back to see from whence it had come. at that moment<br>
charles angell dashed forward in a frantic manner. he had flung his gun from him; his eyeballs were<br>
fixed and staring; there was foam upon his lips; his hair was streaming in the wind. he bore an aspect<br>
so strange and fearful that the french uttered yells of terror, and fled helter skelter from the onslaught.<br>
but if any had had eyes to note it, there was one frenchman whose face became ashy white as he met<br>
the rolling yaze of those terrible, bloodshot eyes. he too flung away his yun, and ullered a frantic yell<br>
of terror, plunging headlong into the wood without a thought save flight, it is he it is he it is he this<br>
was the shout which rang from the lips of charles as he dashed after the retreating figure. all was<br>
confusion now amid french and rangers alike; that awful yell, and something in the appearance of<br>
charles, had startled friend and foe alike. there were several of the french soldiers left dead in the wood,<br>
one was captured and made prisoner; but the rest had fled like men demented, and the rangers<br>
could not come up with them. as for charles and his quarry, they had disappeared, and it was long<br>
before any trace could be found of them. stark and fritz, however, would not give up the search, and at<br>
last they came upon the prostrate form of charles. he lay face downwards on the frozen ground, which<br>
was deeply stained with blood. his wrist was fearfully gashed by some knife; yet in his fingers he held<br>
still a piece of cloth from the coat of the french fugitive. it had been literally torn out of his grasp<br>
before the man could get free, and he had nearly hacked off the left hand of the hapless charles. yet<br>
thither where we have been, and you shall know the wherefore. in such sort made they answer to the<br>
folk. these two knights died in this holy life, nor were none other tidings never brought thence by<br>
them, they of that land called them saints. xxviihere endeth the story of the most holy graal. josephus,<br>
by whom it is placed on record, giveth the benison of our lord to all that hear and honour it, the latin<br>
from whence this history was drawn into romance was taken in the isle of avalon, in a holy house of<br>
religion that standeth at the head of the moors adventurous, there where king arthur and queen<br>
quenievre lie, according to the witness of the good men religious that are therein, that have the whole<br>
history thereof, true from the beginning even to the end. after this same history beginneth the story<br>
how briant of the isles renounced king arthur on account of lancelot whom he loved not, and how he<br>
assured king claudas that reft king ban of benoic of his land. this story telleth how he conquered him<br>
and by what means, and how galobrus of the red launde came to king arthurs court to help lancelot,<br>
for that he was of his lineage. this story is right long and right adventurous and weighty, but the</p>
