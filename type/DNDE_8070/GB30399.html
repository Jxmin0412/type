<p>was but conjectured, upon seeing him felt assured of being in the right track. here were to be seen on<br>
swells in their tandems the nib sprigs in their gigs, buggies, and dog carts and the tidy ones in<br>
their trotters, all alive and leaping. mirth and merriment appeared spread over every countenance, though<br>
expectation and anxiety were intermingled here and there in the features of the real lads of the fancy;<br>
many of whom, upon this very interesting occasion, had bets to a considerable amount depending upon<br>
the result of the day. the bang up blades were pushing their prads along in gay style, accompanied by<br>
two friends, that is to say, a biped and a quadruped. the queer fancy lads, who had hired hacks from<br>
the livery stable keepers, were kicking up a dust, and here and there rolling from their prancers on<br>
their native soil; while the neck or nothing boys, with no prospect but a career whereas before their<br>
eyes, were as heedless of their personal safety as they were of their creditora property. jaded hacks and crazy<br>
vehicles were to be seen on all sides here lay a bankrupt cart with the panels knockdin, and its driver<br>
with an eye knockd out, the horse lamed, and the concern completely knockd up, just before the period<br>
when the hammer of the auctioneer was to be called in, and his effects knockd down, there was another<br>
curry the coal make sure of the money. of the same description, with a harum scarum devil of a half<br>
bred, making his way at all risks, at a full gallop, as unmanageable in his career as his driver had<br>
been in his speculations; dust flying, women sprawling, men bawling, dogs barking, and the multitude<br>
continually increasing, scouts, scamps, lords, loungers and lacqueys coster mongers from to the hill<br>
fields and the bloods from bermondsey, completely lined the roад as far as the eye could reach, both<br>
hopelessly unmarried woman to you, my dear oh, child, you need not protest a kinder opinion i am<br>
just caleb hunters spinster sister to the people of this village. but to to myself, barbara, i am at times<br>
the same girl who waited, roses in her hair and roses in her cheeks, for him to come, so that i might<br>
tell him that i was his, body and soul. and he never came oh, my dear, i do not mean to break down<br>
like this, for you have your own heart ache. but i trusted to morrow, i told myself that to morrow would<br>
be soon enough, and when to morrow came they let me go to him. he died very bravely, barbara, to<br>
save the life of another, since you are so sure, i can tell you this without seeming to warn you without<br>
being accused of attempting to influence you. but i know why i say that every woman, if<br>
she is perhaps not to blame will not let her consider the happiness of the man<br>
she loves, should still take care that she does not barter for an hour of quickened pulses the happiness<br>
of her whole life. i was innocent enough. it was harmless play to me but i have paid and paid and<br>
paid i would not have you, whom i cherish, rise each morning and wonder why you had to be the only<br>
one to suffer out of thousands who played the same way. and now will you please forgive me this<br>
uncontrolled moment i usually inflict them upon no one; i hide them in my room. but, barbara, i was<br>
so proud of him so sure so positive that he was the only man in the world and i lost my chance to tell<br>
him. no hour for idle grief. carlos kissed the cold lips hastily embraced his weeping sister his love.<br>

we must go hence. as he uttered these words, he wrapped the serape around the corpse, lifted it in<br>
his arms, and passed out of the rancho. the others had already preceded him to the spot where the<br>
horses were concealed. carlos saw that there were five of these animals. a gleam of joy shot from his<br>
eyes as he recognised his noble steed. antonio had recovered him. antonio was there, on the spot. all<br>
were in the saddles. two of the horses carried rosita and catalina; the other two were ridden by<br>
antonio and the groom andres. the cibolero himself, carrying his strange burden, was sprang upon<br>
the back of his faithful steed. down the valley, master inquired antonio. carlos hesitated a moment<br>
as if deliberating, no, replied he at length. they would follow us that way, by the pass of la<br>
nina, they will not suspect us of taking the cliff road. lead on, antonio: the chapparal path you know<br>
it best. the cavalcade started, and in a few minutes had passed the borders of the town, and was<br>
winding its way through the devious path that led to the pass of la nina. no words were exchanged, or<br>
only a whisper, as the horses in single file followed one another through the chapparal. an hours silent</p>
