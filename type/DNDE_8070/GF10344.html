everything, but how silly he looks now i will wake him. she pulled a blade of grass out of the heap on<br>
which he was lying, and saucily tickled his nose. nebsecht raised himself, sneezed, but fell back asleep<br>
again; uarda laughed out with her clear silvery tones. then she blushed that is not right, she said, for<br>
he is good and generous. she took the sleepers hand, pressed it to her lips, and wiped the drops from<br>
his brow. then he awoke, opened his eyes, and muttered half in a dream still: uarda sweet uarda, the<br>
girl started up and fled, and nefert followed her. when nebsecht at last got upon his feet and looked<br>
round him, he found himself alone in a strange house, he went out of doors, where he found bent anals<br>
little train anxiously discussing things past and to come. chapter xxxvi. the inhabitants of the oasis<br>
had for centuries been subject to the pharaohs, and paid them tribute; and among the rights granted<br>
to them in return, no egyptian soldier might cross their border and territory without their permission.<br>
the ethiopians had therefore pitched bent anats tents and their own camp outside these limits; but<br>
various transactions took place between the idle warriors and the amalekites, which now and then<br>
led to quarrels, and which on some evening threatened serious consequences, when some drunken soldiers had<br>
annoyed the amalekite women while they were drawing water. this morning early one of the drivers<br>
awaking had missed pentaur and nebsecht, and he roused his comrades, who had been rejoined by<br>
uardas father. the enraged guard of the gang of prisoners hastened to the commandant of the<br>
ethiopians, and informed him that two of his prisoners had escaped, and were no doubt being kept in<br>
concealment by the amalekites. the amalekites met the requisition to surrender the fugitives, of whom<br>
having, withal, the office of major of the island. but seeing the great preparations that lolonois made<br>
for this expedition, he joined him, and offered him, that if he would make him his chief captain by<br>
land seeing he knew the country very well, and all its avenues he would share in his fortunes, and go<br>
with him. they agreed upon articles to the great joy of lolonois, knowing that basco had done great<br>
actions in europe, and had the repute of a good soldier, thus they all embarked in eight vessels, that<br>
of lolonois being the greatest, having ten guns of indifferent carriage. all things being ready, and the<br>
whole company on board, they set sail together about the end of april, being, in all, six hundred and<br>
sixty persons. they steered for that part called bayala, north of hispaniola: here they took into their<br>
company some french hunters, who voluntarily offered themselves, and here they provided themselves<br>
with victuals and necessaries for their voyage, from hence they sailed again the last of july, and<br>
steered directly to the eastern cape of the isle called punta despada. hereabouts espying a ship from<br>
puerto rico, bound for new spain, laden with cocoa nuts, lolonois commanded the rest of the fleet to<br>
wait for him near savona, on the east of cape punta despada, he alone intending to take the said<br>
vessel. the spaniards, though they had been in sight full two hours, and knew them to be pirates, yet<br>
would not flee, but prepared to fight, being well armed, and provided. the combat lasted three hours,<br>
and then they surrendered. this ship had sixteen guns, and fifty fighting men aboard: they found in<br>
her, one weight of cocoa,, pieces of eight, and the value of, more in jewels. lolonois sent the vessel presently<br>
to tortuga to be unladed, with orders to return as soon as possible to savona, where he would wait for<br>
heavy blows on shields and helmets, and the whole bewildering tumult of the battle with a loud shout<br>
he drew his bow, and his first arrow pierced a cheta chief. his lions sprang forward, and carried<br>
confusion into the hosts that were crowding down upon him, for many of their horses became<br>
unmanageable at the war of the furious brutes, overthrew the chariots, and so hemmed the advance of<br>
the troops in the rear. rameses sent arrow after arrow, while mena covered him with the shield from the<br>
shots of the enemy. his horses meanwhile had carried him forward, and he could fell the foremost of the<br>
asiatics with his battle axe; close by his side fought rameri and three other princes; in front of him<br>
were the lions. the press was fearful, and the raging of the battle wild and deafening, like the roar of<br>
the surging ocean when it is hurled by a hurricane against a rocky coast. mena seemed to be in two<br>
places at once, for, while he guided the horses forwards, backwards, or to either hand, as the exigences<br>
of the position demanded, not one of the arrows shot at the king touched him. his eye was everywhere,<br>
