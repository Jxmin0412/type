round st. pauls across the parks, through the new streets along the strand, or over the docks, the<br>
whole of which may be avoided at the expence of a few shillings. you have only to clap into their<br>
pocket in the morning this invaluable little article, turn them out for the day, and, if by good luck<br>
they should not fall into the hands of sharpers and swindlers, your dear coz will return safe home at<br>
night, with his head full of wonders, and his pockets empty of cash the C. al, whispered bob, he seems to<br>
know what scent is upon. aye, replied his cousin, he not only knows that some of your cash will soon<br>
come to be in his pockets, and has therefore made a dead set at you. next lot, gentlemen, is a work to<br>
which my last observation bore some allusion; should your friends, as i then observed, fortunately<br>
escape the snares and dangers laid by sharpers and swindlers to entrap the unwary, you may,<br>
perchance, see them safe after their days ramble; but should aye, gentlemen, theres the rub should<br>
they be caught by the numerous traps and snares laid for the johnny raw and greenhorn in this great<br>
and wicked metropolis, god knows what may become of them. now, gentlemen, we have a remedy for<br>
every disease here is the london spy or strangers guide through the metropolis; here all the arts,<br>
frauds, delusions, are exposed, and tom, give that gentleman change for his half crown, and deliver<br>
lot as i was before observing, gentlemen, turn out that young rascal who is making such a noise,<br>
cracking nuts, that i cant hear the bidding, gentlemen, as i before observed, if you will disguised by a<br>
shabby flavour of sugar. but that outside once disposed of, there lies an almond at the core. now an<br>
almond is a very delicious thing in itself, and doubly nice when it takes the taste of white paint and<br>
chalk out of ones mouth, but in spite of all the white lead and sugar and chalk through which he had<br>
sucked his way, macgreedy could not come to the almond. a dozen times had he been on the point of<br>
spitting out the delusive sweetmeat; but just as he thought of it he was sure to feel a bit of hard<br>
rough edge, and thinking he had gained the kernel at last, he held valiantly on. it only proved to be a<br>
rough bit of sugar, however, and still the interminable coating melted copiously in his mouth; and<br>
still the clean, fragrant almond evaded his hopes. at last with a groan he spat the seemingly<br>
undiminished bonbon on to the floor, and turned as white and trembling as an arrowroot blanc mange.<br>
in obedience to the widows entreaties the tutor opened a window, and tried to carry macgreedy to the<br>
air; but that young gentleman utterly refused to allow the tutor to approach him, and was borne<br>
howling to bed by his татта. with the fresh air the fumes of the fragrant smoke dispersed, and the<br>
company roused themselves. rather oppressive, eh said the master of the house, who had had his dream<br>
out too, with which we have no concern. the dogs had had theirs also, and had testified to the same in<br>
their sleep by low growls and whines. now they shook themselves, and rubbed against each other,<br>
growling in a warlike manner through their teeth, and wagging peaceably with their little stumpy<br>
tails. the twins shook themselves, and fell to squabbling as to whether they had been to sleep or no;<br>
and, if either, which of them had given way to that weakness. miss letitia took the paper bonnet from<br>
her sir. what is it cried allertssohn, looking at the dove. herr von warmond, a young man after gods own<br>
heart, has just brought me two falcons; do you want to see how i tame them no, captain, i have<br>
enough to do with my music and my doves. that is your affair, the long necked one yonder is a queer<br>
looking fellow. and of what country is he probably a native there he goes to join the others, watch him a<br>
little while and then answer me. ask king soloman that; he was on intimate terms with birdo. only<br>
watch him, youll find out presently. the fellow has a stiff neck, and holds his head unusually high.<br>
and his beak curved, almost like a hawks zounds, why does the creature strut about with its toes so<br>
far apart stop, bandit hell peck that little dove to death. as true as i live, the saucy rascal must be a<br>
spaniard right, it is a spanish dove. it flew to me, but i cant endure it and drive it away; for i keep<br>
only a few pairs of the same breed and try to get the best birds possible. whoever raises many different<br>
kinds in the same cote, will accomplish nothing, that gives food for thought. but i believe you havent<br>
chosen the handsomest species. no, what you see are a cross between the carrier and tumblers, the<br>
antwerp breed of carrier pigeons. bluish, reddish, spotted birds. i dont care for the colors, but they</p>
