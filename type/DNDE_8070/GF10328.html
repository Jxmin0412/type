many reasons to disagree with him. embarrassed, bloc ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet,<br>
his anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the lawyer for<br>
a while, he thought only about himself and turned the judges words round to examine them from all<br>
sides, bloc, said leni, as if reprimanding him, and, taking hold of the collar of his coat, pulled him up<br>
slightly higher. leave the carpet alone and listen to what the lawyer is saying. in the cathedral a very<br>
important italian business contact of the bank had come to visit the city for the first time and was<br>
given the task of showing him some of its cultural sights. at any other time he would have seen this<br>
job as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even to maintain his current position in the<br>
bank, he accepted it only with reluctance. every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of<br>
concern for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office anything like as well as<br>
he had previously, he spent many hours merely pretending to do important work, but that only<br>
increased his anxiety about not being in the office. then he sometimes thought he saw the deputy<br>
director, who was always watching, come into k.s office, sit at his desk, look through his papers,<br>
receive clients who had almost become old friends of and lure them away from him, perhaps he even<br>
discovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten from a thousand directions when he was at work<br>
now, and which he could no longer avoid. so now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on business<br>

fountain of water was issuing from a broken pipe, which arose as high as a two pair of stairs window,<br>
a circumstance which quickly drew a number of spectators around, and, among the rest, tom and his<br>
cousin could not resist an inclination to spend a few minutes in viewing the proceedings, the irish<br>
jontlemen, who made two or three ineffectual attempts to stop the breach, alternately got soused by the<br>
increased violence of the water, and at every attempt were saluted by the loud laughter of the<br>
surrounding multitude. to feelings naturally warm and initable, these vociferations of amusement and<br>
delight at their defeat, served but to exasperate and enrage; and the irishmen in strong terms expressed<br>
their indignation at the merriment which their abortive attempts appeared to excile: at length, one of<br>
the paddies having cut a piece of wood, as he conceived, sufficient to stop the effusion of water, with<br>
some degree of adroitness thrust his arm into the foaming fluid, and for a moment appeared to have<br>
arrested its progress. blood and owns murphy, cried he, scoop away the water, and be after handing over<br>

and helped the physicians to bind up his burns, when the cry of fire had been first raised, pentaur was<br>
sitting in earnest conversation with the high priest; he had learned that he was not the son of a<br>
gardener, but a descendant of one of the noblest families in the land, the foundations of life seemed to<br>
be subverted under his feet, amenis revelation lifted him out of the dust and set him on the marble floor<br>
of a palace; and yet pentaur was neither excessively surprised nor inordinately rejoiced; he was well<br>
used to find his joys and sufferings depend on the man within him, and not on the circumstances<br>
without. as soon as he heard the cry of fire, he hastened to the burning pavilion, and when he saw the<br>
kings danger, he set himself at the head of a number of soldiers who had hurried up from the<br>
camp, intending to venture an attempt to save rameses from the inside of the house. among those who<br>
