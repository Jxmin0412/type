<p>PAGE 0316<br>was really bad. that could well be, said turning away, but it does not excuse you. theres no one i know<br>whod hold it against me, said the woman. him, who put his arms around me, hes been chasing after<br>me for a long time. i mite not be very attractive for most people, but i am for him. ive yot no<br>protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job hes got to<br>pul up with it as that mans a student and hell almost certainly be very powerful later on. hes always<br>after me, hed only just left when you arrived. that fits in with everything else, and im not surprised. do<br>you want to make things a bit better here the woman asked slowly, watching him as if she were<br>saying something that could be as dangerous for as for herself. thats what i thought when i heard you<br>speak, i really liked what you said. mind you, i only heard part of it, i missed the beginning of it and<br>at the end i was lying on the floor with the student its so horrible here, she said after a pause, and<br>took hold of ks hand. do you believe you really will be able to make things beller smiled and twisted<br>his hand round a little in her soft hands. its really not my job to make things better here, as you put<br>it, he said, and if you said that to the examining judge he would laugh at you or punish you for it. i<br>really would not have become involved in this matter if i could have helped it, and i would have lost no<br>sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better. but because im told that i have been<br>arrested and it forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake.<br>however, if i can be of some service to you in the process i will, of course, be glad to do so, and i will<br>be glad to do so not only for the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me. how<br>was answering him he thought that he heard people muttering in the choir; but it was only<br>the echo of his own voice, his own voice tossed from pillar to pillar and arch to arch, till it faded into<br>a wail of sharnall, sharnall in the lantern. it was the first time that he had been in the church at<br>night, and he stood for a moment overcome with the mystery of the place, while he gazed at the<br>columns of the nave standing while in the moonlight like a row of vast shrouded figures. he called<br>again to mr sharnall, and again received no answer, and then he made his way up the nave to the<br>little doorway that leads to the organ loft stairs. this door also was open, and he felt sure now that mr<br>sharnall was not in the organ loft at all, for had he been he would certainly have locked himself in.<br>the pedal note must be merely ciphering, or something, perhaps a book, might have fallen upon it, and<br>was holding it down. he need not go up to the loft now; he would not go up. the throbbing of the low<br>note had on him the same unpleasant effect as on a previous occasion. he tried to reassure himself, yet<br>felt all the while a growing premonition that something might be wrong, something might be terribly<br>wrong. the lateness of the hour, the isolation from all things living, the spectral moonlight which made<br>the darkness darker this combination of utter silence, with the distressing vibration of the pedal note,<br>filled him with something akin to panic. it seemed to him as if the place was full of phantoms, as if<br>the monks of saint sepulchres were risen from under their gravestones, as if there were other dire faces<br>among them such as wait continually on deeds of evil. he checked his alarm before it mastered him. he<br>firmly to the handle and looked down onto the square outside. the snow was still falling, the<br>weather still had not brightened up at all. he remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing<br>what it actually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance, slightly startled, over<br>his shoulder at the door to the outer room where, mistakenly, he thought hed heard some noise.<br>and that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his face with cold water<br>and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his place by the window. the decision to take his defence<br>into his own hands now seeтед more of a burden than he had originally assumed. all the while he had<br>left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had little basic affect on him, he had observed it from<br>afar as something that was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he looked to see<br>how things stood but he was also able to draw his head back again whenever he wanted. now, in<br>contrast, if he was to conduct his defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the court<br>for the time being, at least success would mean, later on, his complete and conclusive liberation, but if</p>
