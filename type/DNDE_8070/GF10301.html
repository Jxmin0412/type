<p>century ago, the pretty feathery pale green shrub grew in every country door yard, humble or great,<br>
throughout new england, and every church going woman picked a branch or spray of it when she left<br>
her home on sabbath morn. to this day, on hot summer sundays, many a staid old daughter of the<br>
puritans may be seen entering the village meeting house, clad in a lilac sprigged lawn or a<br>
striped bar√®ge, a scanty skirted, surplice waisted relic of past summers, with a lace bordered silk cape<br>
on a delicate, time yellowed, purple and white cashmere scarf on her bent shoulders, wearing on<br>
her gray head a shirred silk or leghorn bonnet, and carrying in her lace mitted hand a fresh handkerchief,<br>
her spectacle case and well worn bible, and a great sprig of the sweet, old fashioned lads love. a<br>
bunch of mignonette would be to her too gay a posy for the lords house and the lords day. and no<br>
balmier breath than was ever borne by blossom is the pure fragrance of green growing things,<br>
southernwood, mint, sweet fern, bayberry, sweetbrier. nor a rose is half so fresh, so countrified, so<br>
sweet. the benches and the pew seats in the old churches were never cushioned. occasionally very old or<br>
feeble women brought cushions to meeting to sit upon. it is a matter of recent tradition that colonel<br>
greenleaf caused a nine days talk in newbury town at the beginning of this century when he cushioned<br>
his pew, the widow of sir william pepperell, who lived in imposing style, had her pew cushioned and<br>
lined and curtained with worsted stuff, and carpeted with a heavy bear skin. this worn, faded, and moth<br>
eaten furniture remained in the kittery church until the year, just as when lady pepperell furnished and<br>
occupied the pew. nor were even the seats of the pulpit cushioned. the cooshoons of velvet or leather,<br>
best they could. on she stood, much bent, but propped on her ivory crutches, eagerly following every<br>
word of a conversation, she looked as though she were prepared at any moment to spring into the<br>
middle of it and interrupt the speaker. she always said exactly what she meant without reserve or ruth;<br>
and throughout her long life, as the mistress of great wealth, she had always been allowed to have her<br>
own way, she asserted her rights even over her son, though he was the centre of a web whose threads<br>
reached to the furthest circumference of the known world. the peasants who tilled the earth by the<br>
upper and lower nile, the shepherds who kept their flocks in the arabian desert, in syria, on the<br>
silphium meads of cyrenaica, the wood cutters of lebanon and pontus, the mountaineers of hispania and<br>
sardinia, the brokers, merchants, and skippers of every port on the mediterranean, were bound by these<br>
threads to the villa on the shore of marectis, and felt the tie when the master there docile as a boy to<br>
his mothers will tightened or released his hold. his possessions, even in his youth, had been so vast<br>
that their increment could bring no added enjoyment to him or his family, and yet their increase had<br>
become his lifes task. he strove for a higher sum to figure on the annual balance sheet, as eagerly as<br>
an athlete strives for a prize; and his mother not only inspected the account, but watched every<br>
important undertaking with keen interest. when her son and his colleagues doubted over some decision<br>
it was she who gave the casting vole; but though her advice in most cases proved sound and profitable,<br>
church and town records, we plainly discover that each laic, deacon, elder, criminal, singer, and even<br>
the ungodly boy had his alloted place as absolutely assigned to him in the old meeting house as was<br>
the pulpit to the parson. much has been said in semi ridicule of this old custom of seating and<br>
dignifying, yet it did not in reality differ much from our modern way of selling the best pews to<br>
whoever will pay the most. perhaps the old way was the better, since, in the early churches, age,<br>
education, dignity, and reputation were considered as well as wealth. vi. the tithingman and the<br>
sleepers. the most grotesque, the most extraordinary, the most highly colored figure in the dull new<br>
england church life was the tithingman. this fairly burlesque creature impresses me always with a sense<br>
of unreality, of incongruity, of strange happening, like a jesting clown in a procession of monks, like<br>
a strain of low comedy in the sober religious drama of early new england puritan life; so out of place,<br>
so unreal is this fussy, pompous, restless tithingman, with his fantastic wand of office fringed with<br>
dangling foxtails, creaking, bustling, strutting, peering around the quiet meeting house, prodding and<br>
rapping the restless boys, waking the drowsy sleepers; for they slept in country churches in the</p>
