<p>chance for plants to exist they seemed to have grown, died, and turned to earth. here and there, too,<br>
the party made their way from cell to cell there were proofs that various animals had taken possession<br>
of the rough shelters and brought the prey they had captured, stores of well gnawed bones lying<br>
scattered about; but saving the traces left of construction, culling out of the rock and building in, they<br>
found nothing to show what kind of people they were who had lived there, nothing to prove how far<br>
back it was in the worlds history that the rock city had been occupied by a teeming population. how<br>
long is it since people lived here, father was asked by chris, after they had been wandering about from<br>
cell to cell but not finding any way of getting higher without a dangerous climb from the terrace<br>
outward. ah, you are asking what has been puzzling me, replied the doctor, and i seem to be faced by<br>
a blank wall built up between now and the past. if we could find anything in the shape of weapons or<br>
household implements, one might make a guess; but every trace we have found is of the last<br>
inhabitants. well, that ought to do, said chris. but i seem the pumas or jaguars that seem to have<br>
here and there turned the cells into caves, and left their gnawed bones about. they may have lived here<br>
fifty years ago, or a hundred years, or five. but there is one thing evident, and it is this that the people<br>
who lived here chose the place as being one that they could make into a stronghold, one which they<br>
could fortify so as to defend themselves from their enemies. what enemies, sir asked ned sharply. ah,<br>
lady im going to paint, i open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or something,<br>
by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush, and meanwhile her little sisters will be keeping<br>
guard for her, moving about and causing chaos in every corner of the room. or else, like happened<br>
yesterday, i mite come back home late in the evening please forgive my appearance and the room being<br>
in a mess, il is to do with them so, i mile come home late in the evening and want to go to bed, then i<br>
feel something pinching my leg, look under the bed and pull another of them out from under it. i dont<br>
know why it is they bother me like this, i expect you've just seen that i do nothing to encourage them<br>
and they make it hard for me to do my work too, of course. if i didnt get this studio<br>
for nothing id have moved out a long time ago, just then, a little voice, tender and anxious, called out<br>
from under the door, titorelli, can we come in now no, answered the painter, not even just me, by myself<br>
the voice asked again, not even just you, said the painter, as he went to the door and locked it.<br>
meanwhile, had been looking round the room, if it had not been pointed out it would never have<br>
occurred to him that this wretched little room could be called a studio. it was hardly long enough or<br>
broad enough to make two steps. everything, floor, walls and ceiling, was made of wood, between the<br>
planks narrow gaps could be seen. across from where was, the bed stood against the wall under a<br>
covering of many different colours. in the middle of the room a picture stood on an. easel, covered over<br>
with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground. behind was the window through which the fog<br>
in the navy, until he found that he had been the owner of what is called a dry goods store, which<br>
mean a shop where things are sold which are not good to eat or drink such as drapery. at<br>
last somebody said, that as there was a public house called the duke of wellington at the corner of the<br>
street, there probably had been a nearer one called the nelson, which had been burnt down, and that<br>
the man who built the nelson had built the house with the spruce fir before it, and that so the name<br>
had arisen. an explanation which was just so far probable, that public houses and fires were of<br>
frequent occurrence in those parts, but this has nothing to do with the story. only we must say, as we<br>
said before, and as we should have said had we been living there then, the child we speak of lived in<br>
the little white house with one spruce fir just in front of it. of all the children who looked forward to<br>
the christmas tree, he looked forward to it the most intensely. he was an imaginative child, of a simple,<br>
happy nature, easy to please. his father was an englishman, and in the long winter evenings he would<br>
tell the child tales of the old country, to which his mother would listen also. perhaps the parents<br>
enjoyed these stories the most. to the boy they were new, and consequently delightful, but to the<br>
parents they were old; and as regards some stories, that is better still. what kind of a bird is this 01</p>
