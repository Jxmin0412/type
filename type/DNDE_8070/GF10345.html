who, with his left hand, tightly held the reins, and with his right the shield which was to protect his<br>
sovereign in the fight. the king stood like a storm proof oak, and mena by his side like a sapling ash.<br>
the eastern horizon was rosy with the approaching sun rise when they quilted the precincts of the<br>
camp; at this moment the pioneer paaker advanced to meet the king, threw himself on the ground<br>
before him, kissed the earth, and, in answer to the kings question as to why he had come without his<br>
brother, told him that horus was taken suddenly ill. the shades of dawn concealed from the king the<br>
guilty color, which changed to sallow paleness, on the face of the pioneer unaccustomed hitherto to<br>
lying and treason. how is it with the enemy asked rameses. he is aware, replied paaker, that a fight is<br>
impending, and is collecting numberless hosts in the camps to the south and east of the city, if thou<br>
couldst succeed in falling on the rear from the north of kadesh, while the foot soldiers seize the camp<br>
of the asiatics from the south, the fortress will be thine before night. the mountain path that thou<br>
must follow, so as not to be discovered, is not a bad one. are you ill or well your brother, em<br>
asked the king. your voice trembles. i was never better, answered the mohar. lead the way, commanded<br>
the king, and paaker obeyed. they went on in silence, followed by the vast troop of chariots through<br>
the dewy morning air, first across the plain, and then into the mountain range. the corps of ra,<br>
with bows and arrows, preceeded them to clear the way; they crossed the narrow bed of a dry torrent,<br>
and then a broad valley opened before them, extending to the right and left and enclosed by ranges of<br>
it already, said griggs, as about twenty of the indians rode round the curve into sight, and their quick<br>
eyes grasped the fact at once that something had happened at the gap since they passed by. look out<br>
ware arrows, said griggs, in a low, deep growl. tell em, doctor, that they neednt mind those plaything<br>
toys so long as they keep well under cover, we can hear what you say, said bourne, and as a<br>
half minute passed, before there was a sudden yell, sounding wild and harsh, to echo and re echo from<br>
the mighty walls on either side, while as it went reverberating on from side to side, to die away in the<br>
distance, there was another shout, and close upon it the whizz of a flight of arrows, and then a<br>
tinkling, splintering sound as they struck against the stones, to snap or glance off, the air just about<br>
the barrier seeming for a moment full of the glistening barbed wands, fire said the doctor loudly, and<br>
crack crack crack with measured slowness the rifles of all three rang out, to raise a fresh set of echoes,<br>
and as these were still repeating themselves another and a fiercer yell rang out, for three of the<br>
mounted men had gone down and their horses had dashed forward, charging right at the barrier,<br>
snorting and tossing their manes, but only to turn back, startled by the heap of rocks piled up before<br>
them, and returned at a fierce gallop, to confuse the crowd they had left, when the rifles from the other<br>
side flashed out fire and white puffs of smoke, and three more of the enemy went down, to free their<br>
startled and plunging ponies from their riders reins. a yell more fierce than ever arose from the little<br>
crowd of indians, whose mounts began to partake of the excitement imparted by the ponies that had<br>
begun to tear to and fro in the narrow gulch, while after discharging another innocuous flight of<br>
voyages in distant lands. the nile voyage came to an end at thebes of the hundred gates, and here<br>
nothing that could attract the roman travellers remained unvisited, the tombs of the pharaohs<br>
extending into the very heart of the rocky hills, and the grand temples that stood to the west of the<br>
city of the dead, shorn though they were of their ancient glory, filled the emperor with admiration. the<br>
imperial travellers and their companion listened to the famous colossus of memnon, of which the upper<br>
portion had been overthrown by an earthquake, and three times in the dawn they heard it sound.<br>
balbilla described the incident in several long poems which sabina caused to be engraved on the stone<br>
of the colossus. the poetess imagined herself as hearing the voice of memnon singing to his mother eos<br>
while her tears, the fresh morning dew, fell upon the image of her son, fallen before the walls of troy.<br>
these verses she compos√©d in the aeolian dialect, named herself as their writer and informed the readers<br>
among whom she included pontius that she was descended from a house no less noble than that of king<br>
antiochus. the gigantic structures on each bank of the nile fully equalled hadrians expectations,<br>
