liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there mite be some occasion when he would have to let<br>
the painter see he still had them. so he had the pictures taken to his office and locked them in the<br>
lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep them safe from the deputy directors sien for<br>
the next few days. bloc, the businessman dismissing the lawyer had at last made the decision to<br>
withdraw his defence from the lawyer. it was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was the<br>
right decision, but this was ontweighed by his belief in its necessity. this decision, on the day he<br>
intended to go to see the lawyer, took a lot of the strength he needed for his work, he worked<br>
exceptionally slowly, he had to remain in his office a long time, and it was already past ten oclock<br>
when he finally stood in front of the lawyers front door. even before he rang he considered whether it<br>
mite not be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone, a personal conversation would<br>
certainly be very difficult. nonetheless, did not actually want to do without it, if he gave notice by any<br>
other means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated words, and unless leni could<br>
discover anything would never learn how the lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences<br>
mite be, in the lawyers not unimportant opinion. but sitting in front of him and taken by surprise by<br>
his dismissal, would be able easily to infer everything he wanted from the lawyers face and behaviour,<br>
even if he could not be induced to say very much. it was not even out of the question that he mite, after<br>
all, be persuaded that it would be best to leave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal.<br>
dust swirled around in front of kis eyes, robbing him of breath for some time. moorland landscape, said<br>
the painter passing the picture to it showed two sickly trees, well separated from each other in dark<br>
grass. in the background there was a multi coloured sunset. thats nice, said ill buy it. expressed<br>
himself in this curt way without any thought, so he was glad when the painter did not take this amiss<br>
and picked up a second painting from the floor. this is a counterpart to the first picture, said the<br>
painter. perhaps it had been intended as a counterpart, but there was not the slightest difference to be<br>
seen between it and the first picture, there were the trees, there the grass and there the sunset. but this<br>
was of little importance to they are beautiful landscapes, he said, ill buy them both and hang them in<br>
my office. you seem to like this subject, said the painter, picking up a third painting, good job ive<br>
still got another, similar picture here. the picture though, was not similar, rather it was exactly the<br>
same moorland landscape, the painter was fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures.<br>
ill take this one too, said how much do the three paintings cost we can talk about that next time, said<br>
the painter. youre in a hurry now, and well still be in contact. and besides, im glad you like the<br>
paintings, ill give you all the paintings ive got down here. theyre all moorland landscapes, ive painted<br>
a lot of moorland landscapes. a lot of people dont like that sort of picture because theyre too gloomy,<br>
but there are others, and youre one of them, who love gloomy themes. but was not in the mood to hear<br>
entitled it to rank high among the jeu desprit productions of this lively age to describe it were<br>
impossible to enjoy it must be to possess it; but for the information of such of our readers as are<br>
remote from the metropolis, it may perhaps be necessary to give something like a key of explanation<br>
to its title. a certain learned gentleman, formerly the editor of the times, said now to be the conductor<br>
of the new times, who has by his writings rendered himself obnoxious to a numerous class of readers,<br>
has been long known by the title of dr. slop; in his publication, denominated the mock times, and the<br>
slop pail, he has been strenuous in his endeavours to support and uphold a society said to mis call<br>
themselves the constitutional society, but now denominated the bridge street gang; and the publication<br>
alluded to, contains humorous and satirical parodies, and sketches of the usual contents of his slop<br>
pail; with a life of the learned doctor, and an account of the origin of the gang. here, said lom, we are<br>
introduced inlo a fine field of observation. the inhabitant of this house defended himself in three<br>
different trials for the publication of alleged impious, profane, and scandalous libels on the catechism,<br>
the litany, and the creed of st. athanasius, with a boldness, intrepidity, and perseverance, almost<br>
unparalleled, as they followed in immediate succession, without even an allowance of time for bodily<br>
