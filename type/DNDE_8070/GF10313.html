similar to those i had left behind me. according to the custom of this country, we fired our<br>
muskels, to warn the inhabitants of the settlement of our approach. we arranged our dresses in the<br>
best order we could, and proceeded towards the village. as the report of our guns had been heard,<br>
groups of nondescripts came running out to meet us. i could scarcely tell to what order of beings they<br>
belonged; but on their near approach, i found them to be the new zealand youths, who were settled with<br>
the missionaries. they were habited in the most uncouth dresses imaginable. these pious men, certainly,<br>
have no taste for the picturesque; they had obscured the finest human forms under a coarse huge<br>
clothing. boys not more than fifteen wore jackets reaching to their knees, and buttoned up to the<br>
throat with great black horn buttons, a coarse checked shirt, the collar of which spread half way over<br>
their face, their luxuriant, beautiful hair was cut close off, and each head was crammed into a close<br>
scotch bonnet these half converted, or rather, half covered, youths, after rubbing noses, and chattering<br>
with our guides, conducted us to the dwellings of their masters. as i had a letter of introduction from<br>
one of their own body, i felt not the slightest doubt of a kind reception; so we proceeded with<br>
confidence. we were ushered into a house, all cleanliness and comfort, all order, silence, and<br>
unsociability, after presenting my letter to a grave looking personage, it had to undergo a private<br>
inspection in an adjoining room, and the result was an invitation to stay and take a cup of tea all<br>
was announced that the family were returning to cullerne, it was decided to celebrate the event by<br>
ringing a peal from the tower of saint sepulchres. the proposal originated with canon parkyn. it is a<br>
graceful compliment, he said, to the nobleman to whose munificence the restoration is so largely due.<br>
we must show him how much stronger we have made our old tower, eh, mr westray we must get the<br>
carisbury ringers over to teach cullerne people how such things should be done. sir george will have to<br>
stand out of his fees longer than ever, if he is to wait till the tower tumbles down now. eh, eh ah, i do<br>
dote on these old customs, assented his wife. it is so delightful, a merry peal. i do think these good<br>
old customs should always be kept up. it was the cheapness of the entertainment that particularly<br>
appealed to her. but is it necessary, my dear, she demurred, to bring the ringers over from carisbury<br>
they are a sad drunken lot. i am sure there must be plenty of young men in cullerne, who would<br>
delight to help ring the bells on such an occasion, but westray would have none of it, it was true, he<br>
said, that the tie rods were fixed, and the tower that much the stronger; but he could countenance no<br>
ringing till the great south east pier had been properly under pinned. his remonstrances found little<br>
favour. lord blandamer would think it an ungracious. lady blandamer, to be sure, counted for very<br>
little; it was ridiculous, in fact, to think of ringing the minster bells for a landladys niece, but lord<br>
blandamer would certainly be offended. i call that clerk of the works a sain young upstart, mis parkyn<br>
ran her face from the point of her chin up her right cheek to her forehead, and then from her forehead down<br>
her left cheek back to her chin, and he found that she was a very nice thing too. but the dairymaid<br>
screamed, good gracious where did that nasty strange dog come from leave him alone, miss daisy, he<br>
hell bite your nose off. he wont said daisy indignantly. hes the dog daddy promised me; and the farmer<br>
coming out at that minute, she ran up to him crying, daddy isnt this my dog bless the child, said<br>
the farmer; its a nice little pup im going to give thee. where did that dirty old brute come from he<br>
would wash, said little daisy, holding very fast to flaps coat. fine washing too said the dairymaid, and<br>
his hairs all luys. i could comb them, said daisy, hes no but got one eye, said the swineherd, haw haw<br>
haw he sees me with the other, said daisy. hes looking up at me now. and one of his ears is gone cried<br>
the dairy lass. he he he perhaps i could make him a cap, said daisy, as i did when my doll lost her<br>
wig. it had pink ribbons and looked very nice. why, hes lame of a leg, guffawed the two farming men.<br>
see, missy, he hirples on three. i cant run very fast, said daisy, and when im old enough to, perhaps<br>
his leg will be well. why, you dont want this old thing for a play fellow, child said the farmer. i do i<br>
do wept daisy, but why, in the name of whims and whamsies because i love him, said daisy. when it<br>
comes to this with the heart, argument is wasted on the head; but the farmer went on: why hes neither</p>
