had before been imagined but as this strait bears his name, and is often traversed by vessels from<br>
new south wales returning home by way of cape horn. in his majestys ship warsprite passed through<br>
this strait in company with the volage, twenty eight guns, being the first english line of battleship<br>
which had ever made the attempt. a few years since, captain stewart, commanding a colonial vessel out<br>
of port jackson, discovered another strait, which cut off the extreme southern point, making it a<br>
separate island that bears his name, and now almost every year one sealers and whalers are making<br>
additional and useful discoveries along its coasts. these islands lie between lat. and and long.<br>
and e. the opening of the land to which we were now opposite, and which was our destined port, the<br>
accurate eye of cook had observed, but did not attempt the entrance; and it is only about ten years<br>
since, when the two store ships, the dromedary and coromandel, loaded with spars on the coast, that a<br>
small vessel attending on those ships first crossed the bar; but although they took soundings and laid<br>
down buoys, the commanders of the large vessels were afraid of attempting the entrance, which proved<br>
their good sense, for their great draught of water would have rendered the undertaking more hazardous<br>
than the risk was worth. yet during my residence in this country two large vessels crossed the bar, and<br>
recrossed it heavily laden, without the slightest accident one the harmony, of london, tons burden; the<br>
other the elizabeth, of sydney, of nearly equal tonnage but in proof that it is not always safe, a ferr<br>
months after this, two schooners of extremely light draught were lost, though they were both<br>
led away, that if any of them should be taken by the spaniards, they might use them for ransom. thus<br>
they got to their ship, and with all speed put to sea, forcing the prisoners, before they let them go, to<br>
procure them so much flesh as was necessary for their voyage to jamaica. but no sooner had they<br>
weighed anchor, when they saw a troop of about five hundred spaniards, all well armed, at the sea<br>
side: against these they let fly several guns, wherewith they forced them to quit the sands, and retire,<br>
with no small regret to see these pirates carry away so much plate of their churches and houses,<br>
though distant at least forty leagues from the sea. these pirates got, on this occasion, above four<br>
thousand pieces of eight in money, besides much plate, and many jewels; in all, to the value of fifty<br>
thousand pieces of eight, or more. with all this they arrived al jamaica soon after. but this sort of<br>
people being never long masters of their money, they were soon constrained to seek more by the<br>
and captain john davis, presently after his return, was chosen admiral of seven or eight vessels,<br>
he being now esteemed an able conductor for such enterprises. he began his new command by directing<br>
his fleet to the north of cuba, there to wait for the fleet from new spain; but missing his design, they<br>
determined for florida. being arrived there, they landed their men, and sacked a small city named st.<br>
augustine of florida. the castle had a garrison of two hundred men, but could not prevent the pillage of<br>
the city, they effecting it without the least damage from the soldiers or townsmen. of the origin of<br>
guarded, and not so easily to be done. and who did he prove to be after all no other than the well<br>
known major semple, whose depredations of this sort upon the public rendered him notorious. having<br>
finished their repast, tom was for a move; and they took their way along thames street in the direction<br>
for tower hill. this life is all chequerd with pleasures and woes that chase one another like waves of the<br>
deep, each billow, as brightly or darkly it flows, reflecting our eyes as they sparkle or weep; so closely<br>
on our miseries tread, that the laugh is awakd ere the tear can be dried; and as fast as the<br>
rain drop of pity is shed, the goose plumage of folly can turn it aside; but, pledge me a cup if<br>
we can clay with hearts ever light and heads ever wise, be ours the light grief that is sister to<br>
joy, and the short brilliant folly that flashes and dies. the building before us, said tom, is the lover of<br>
london, which was formerly a palace inhabited by the various sovereigns of this country till the reign<br>
of queen elizabeth. fitzstephens says, it was originally built by julius ccesar; but i believe there is no<br>
proof of the truth of this assertion, except that one of the towers is to this day called csars lower, it<br>
seems a place of great security, said bob. yes william the conqueror erected a fortress on part of its<br>
present site, to overawe the inhabitants of london on his gaining possession of the city, and about<br>
