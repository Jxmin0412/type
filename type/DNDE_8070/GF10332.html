to make a stand for the honour of our country and the salvation of canada. ah, my brother, if quebec<br>
goes, canada goes that is so; but there are many of us who say that quebec is not yet lost. it is not<br>
lost; it might well be saved. and yet what think you of this they say that within the hornwork the<br>
governor and the intendant were closeted together drafting the terms of capitulation of the whole<br>
colony, ready to submit to the english general so soon so they say, i know not if it be altogether true,<br>
but all is confusion worse confounded yonder. the soldiers are pouring back to their camp at beauport in<br>
a perfect fever of panic. i heard that bigot would have tried to muster and lead them against the<br>
enemy once more, and that the governor gave his sanction, but that the officers would not second the<br>
suggestion. i think all feel that with only vaudreuil to lead fighting is hopeless. he knows not his own<br>
mind two minutes together; he agrees always with the last speaker. he is always terrified in the<br>
moment of real crisis and peril. his bluster and gasconade desert him, and leave him in a pitiful case.<br>
what, then, is to be done that i cannot tell. i have come with a message from the governor to the<br>
marquis, he sent me to ascertain his condition, and if possible to ask counsel of him. his word would<br>
still carry weight. if he is sufficiently himself to listen for a few minutes to what i have to say, i would<br>
then put the case and ask his opinion upon it. madame drucour drew the abbe softly into the room<br>
where the dying man lay. montcalms eyes opened as he heard them approach. at the sight of the abbe<br>
he seemed to try to rouse himself. you have brought news tell me how goes it the abbe repeated in<br>
his hands, what is paaker plotting how is it that your brother is your enemy he is the elder of us two,<br>
said horus with a trembling voice. when my father died i had only a short time before left the school of<br>
seti, and with his last words my father enjoined me to respect paaker as the head of our family. he is<br>
domineering and violent, and will allow no ones will to cross his; but i bore everything, and always<br>
obeyed him, often against my better judgment. i remained with him two years, then i went to thebes,<br>
and there i married, and my wife and child are now living there with my mother. about sixteen months<br>
afterwards i came back to syria, and we travelled through the country together; but by this time i did<br>
not choose to be the mere tool of my brothers will, for i had grown prouder, and it seemed to me that<br>
the father of my child ought not to be subservient, even to his own brother. we often quarrelled, and<br>
had a bad time together, and life became quite unendurable, when about eight weeks since paaker came<br>
back from thebes, and the king gave him to understand that he approved more of my reports than of<br>
his. from my childhood i have always been softhearted and patient; every one says i am like my<br>
mother; but what paaker made me suffer by words and deeds, that is i could not his voice broke, and<br>
pentaur felt how cruelly he had suffered; then he went on again: what happened to my brother in<br>
egypt, i do not know, for he is very reserved, and asks for no sympathy, either in joy or in sorrow; but<br>
from words he has dropped now and then i gather that he not only bitterly hates mena, the charioteer<br>
who certainly did him an injury but has some grudge against the king too. i spoke to him of it at<br>
at last go into the kitchen that adjoined the sleeping room. in a few moments she perceived through<br>
her half closed eyes, that he, had brought in a light; he had lighted a lamp at the hearth, and now<br>
searched both the rooms. as yet he had not spoken to her, nor opened his lips to utter a word. now he<br>
was in the silling room, and now involuntarily she drew herself into a heap, and pulled the coverlet<br>
over her head now he laughed aloud, so loud and scornfully, that she felt her hands and feet turn cold,<br>
a rushing crimson mist floated before her eyes. then the light came back into the bed room, and<br>
she felt her head pushed by his hard hand, and with a feeble scream she flung<br>
off the coverlet and sat up. still he did not speak a word, but what she saw was quite enough to<br>
smother the last spark of her courage and hope, for her husbands eyes showed only the whites, his<br>
sallow features were ashy pale, and on his brow the branded mark of mithras stood out more clearly<br>
than ever. in his right hand he held the lamp, in his left hermas sheepskin. as his haggard eye met<br>
hers he held the anchorites matted garment so close to her face, that it touched her. then he threw it<br>
violently on the floor, and asked in a low, husky voice, what is that she was silent. he went up to the</p>
