<p>his skill in medicine and the arts of healing might prove of use to the victims of the prison house on<br>
their release. for the sisters and dalaber those days were happily passed, despite the anxiety they felt<br>
as to what might be passing in oxford. to them it seemed as though the clouds of peril which had<br>
hung so long in their sky were rolling fast away. dalaber was relieved from that burden of remorse and<br>
bitter humiliation which had been weighing upon him. humble and contrite for past errors, past<br>
weaknesses, he was, and would remain; but he had delivered his soul by his frank admissions to the<br>
cardinal, and he could respect and admire the dignity and clemency of that powerful man, and be<br>
grateful to him for both. freda was his own, as she had never been before her mind at rest, her heart<br>
satisfied, her old esteem and admiration and trust restored. together they wandered through orchard,<br>
meadow, and woodland, speaking to each other from the bottom of their hearts, unveiling their most<br>
sacred thoughts and feelings, and sharing every aspiration, every hope, every plan for present or<br>
future. the world for them was a pure arcadia; they almost forgot for the time being the<br>
troublous world without. it was like a green oasis in their lives, like a haven of rest and peace after<br>
driving storms and perilous hurricanes. they lived in the sunshine, and thanked god in their hearts, and<br>
received that rest and refreshment of body, soul, and spirit of which both stood rather sorely in need.<br>
on the fifth day, as the sun was drawing towards ils setting, dr. langton returned. they pressed<br>
eagerly round him to learn the news. his face was thoughtful and very grave. they are bringing master<br>
to inspect the hollow in which they knew the village lay. colonel armstrong was one of this party, and<br>
he, with stark and fritz, cautiously crept up on the ridge and looked down upon the indian town<br>
below. the moon lighted up the whole scene. there was no appearance of tumult or excitement. the<br>
sound of the drum and the whooping of the warriors were not accompanied by any demonstration of<br>
activity by those within the community. probably some war party or hunting party had returned with<br>
spoil, and they were celebrating the event by a banquet and a dance, the soldiers were bidden to move<br>
onward, but very cautiously, it was necessary that they should make the descent of the rugged path<br>
before the moon set, and it was abundantly evident that the indians had at present no idea of the<br>
presence of the enemy. slowly and cautiously the soldiers crept down the steep path, doing everything<br>
possible to avoid a noise; but suddenly the sound of a peculiar whistle sounded from somewhere below,<br>
and there were a movement and a thrill of dismay through all the ranks; for surely it was a signal of<br>
discovery only fritz was undismayed, and gave vent to a silent laugh, that is not an alarm, he<br>
whispered to the colonel; it is but a young chief signalling to some squaw. but the place is not asleep<br>
yet; if we go much nearer we shall be seen. those bushes would give us cover till all is quiet. we could<br>
crouch there and rest, and when the time has come spring out upon the village unawares. the colonel<br>
approved the plan, and the weary men were glad enough of the rest before the battle should begin. all<br>
were full of hope and ardour; but in spite of that, most of them fell asleep crouched in the cover. the<br>
surrounding hills kept off the wind, and it was warm beneath the sheltering scrub. but charles sat up<br>
OAL were in the hands of the phoenicians, who sailed from thence southwards to enrich<br>
themselves with the produce of arabia and ophir. pharaoh necho also projected a suez canal, but does<br>
not appear to have carried it out, as the oracle declared that the utility of the undertaking would be<br>
greatest to foreigners, such things can only benefit the asiatics. but seti would not listen to our<br>
counsel. we desired to preserve the old division of the land, but rameses introduced the new to the<br>
disadvantage of the priests; we warned him against fresh wars, and the king again and again has<br>
taken the field; we had the ancient sacred documents which exempted our peasantry from military<br>
service, and, as you know, he outrageously defies them. from the most ancient times no one has been<br>
permitted to raise temples in this land to strange gods, and rameses favors the son of the stranger,<br>
and, not only in the north country, but in the reverend city of memphis and here in thebes, he has<br>
raised altars and magnificent sanctuaries, in the strangers quarter, to the sanguinary false gods of the<br>
east. human sacrifices, which had been introduced into egypt by the phoenicians, were very early</p>
