humbly hope that europe has been found. at present i feel like aladdin when his palace had been<br>
transported by the magician; i dont know where i am. youre here, doctor; arent you asked the slow<br>
curly wigged brother, squalling himself on the grass. is europe found said the doctor tragically. yes,<br>
laughed deordie. i found it, you will be a great man, said the doctor. and it is only common charity to<br>
ask how about north america found too, said deordie. but the wash is completely lost. and my six<br>
shirts in it said the doctor. i sent them last saturday as ever was, what a world we live in any<br>
news poor tiny here has been crying her eyes oul. im so sorry, tiny, said the brother, but dont bother<br>
about it. its all square now, and were going to have a new shelf put up. you found everything<br>
asked tiny, well, not the wash, you know, and the elephant and the guinea pig are yone for good; so<br>
the other elephant and the other guinea pig must walk together as a pair now. noah was among the<br>
soldiers, and we have put the cavalry into a night light box. europe and north america were behind the<br>
book case; and, would you believe it the rocking horses nose has turned up in the nursery oven. i cant<br>
believe it, said the doctor. the rocking horses nose couldnt turn up, it was the purest grecian, modelled<br>
from the elgin marbles. perhaps it was the heat that did it, though. however, you seem to have got<br>
through your troubles very well, master deordie. i wish poor tiny were at the end of her task. so do i,<br>
said deordie ruefully, but i tell you what ive been thinking, doctor. nurse is always nagging at us, and<br>
in a tone which was anything rather than encouraging, as he relaxed his hold on the hounds collar in a<br>
somewhat suspicious manner. the slaves bent knees began to quake, and holding out his broad palm to<br>
the bearded gentleman, who seemed to him hardly less alarming than the dog, he began to<br>
stammer out in fearfully mutilated greek the speech which his master had repeated to him several<br>
times, and which set forth that he had come into the presence of the architect, claudius venator, of<br>
the visit of his master, a member of the town council, a macedonian, and a roman<br>
citizen, keraunus, the son of ptolemy, steward of the once royal but now imperial palace at lochias.<br>
hadrian unrelentingly allowed the poor wretch to finish his speech, rubbing his hands with amusement,<br>
while the sweat of anguish stood on the old slaves face, and to prolong the delightful joke, he took<br>
good care not to help the miserable old man when his unaccustomed tongue came to some insuperable<br>
difficulty. when, at length, the negro had finished the pompous announcement, hadrian said, kindly:<br>
tell your master he may come in. scarcely had the slave left the room, when the sovereign, turning to<br>
his favorite, exclaimed: this is a delicious joke what will the jupiter be like, when the eagle is such a<br>
this keraunus was not long to wait for. while pacing up and down the passage outside the<br>
emperors room, his bad humor had risen considerably, for he took it as a slight on the part of the<br>
architect, that he should allow him whose birth and dignities he would have learnt from his slave to<br>
foundation of cullerne had subscribed in older and richer days, yet these were but the children of a later<br>
birth. round about them stood elder brethren, for cullerne minster was still left in possession of its<br>
seventeenth century music books. a famous set they were, a hundred or more bound in their old black<br>
polished calf, with a great gold medallion, and tenor: decani, or contra tenor: cantoris, or basso, or<br>
stamped in the middle of every cover, and inside was parchment with red ruled margins, and on the<br>
parchment were inscribed services and verse anthems and ffull anthems, all in engrossing hand and the<br>
most uncompromising of black ink. therein was a generous table of contents mr batten and mr gibbons,<br>
lo mr mundy and mr tomkins, doctor bull and doctor giles, all neatly filed and paged; and a bird would<br>
incite singers long since turned to churchyard mould to bring forthe ye timbrell, ye pleasant harp and<br>
ye violl, and reinsist with six parts, and a red capital letter, ye pleasant harp and ye violl. it was a<br>
great place for dust, the organ loft dust that fell, and dust that rose; dust of wormy wood, dust of<br>
crumbling leather, dust of tattered mothy curtains that were dropping to pieces, dust of primeval green<br>
baize; but mr sharnall had breathed the dust for forty years, and felt more at home in that place than<br>
anywhere else. if it was a crusoes island, he was crusce, monarch of all he surveyed. here, you can take<br>
this key, he said one day to westray; it unlocks the staircase door; but either tell me when to expect<br>
