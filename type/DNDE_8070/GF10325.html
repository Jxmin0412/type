spanish dominions in the west indies. here are huge quantities of pigeons at certain seasons. it is<br>
watered by four rivulets, whereof two are always dry in summer. here is no trade or commerce exercised<br>
by the inhabitants; neither do they plant more fruits than what are necessary for human life, though<br>
the country would make very good plantations of tobacco of considerable profit, were it cultivated.<br>
as soon as captain morgan came near the island with his fleet, he sent one of his best sailing vessels to<br>
view the entry of the river, and see if any other ships were there, who might hinder him from landing;<br>
also fearing lest they should give intelligence of his arrival to the inhabitants, and present his<br>
designs. next day, before sunrise, all the fleet anchored near the island, in a bay called aguade grande.<br>
on this bay the spaniards had built a battery, mounted with four pieces of cannon. captain morgan<br>
landed about one thousand men in divers squadrons, marching through the woods, though they had no<br>
other guides than a few of his own men, who had been there before, under mansielt. the same day they<br>
came to a place where the governor sometimes resided: here they found a battery called the platform,<br>
but nobody in it, the spaniards having retired to the lesser island, which, as was said before, is so near<br>
the great one, that a short bridge only may conjoin them. this lesser island was as well fortified with<br>
forts and batteries round it, as might seem impregnable. hereupon, as soon as the spaniards perceived<br>
the pirates approach, they fired on them so furiously, that they could advance nothing that day, but<br>
were content to retreat, and take up their rest in the open fields, which was not strange to these people,<br>
wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there. it would simply mean he had not<br>
understood, that he had understood but chose not to pay attention to it. but if he came turned round<br>
he would be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood perfectly well, that he<br>
really was the josef the priest had called to and that he was willing to follow. if the priest had called<br>
out again one would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything was silent so he also waited, he<br>
turned his head slightly as he wanted to see what the priest was doing now. he was merely standing in<br>
the pulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had see turn his head. if did not now turn round<br>
completely it would have been like a child playing hide and seek. he did so, and the priest beckoned<br>
him with his finger. as everything could now be done openly he ran because of curiosity and the wish<br>
to get it over with with long flying leaps towards the pulpit. at the front pews he stopped, but to the<br>
priest he still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger<br>
to a place immediately in front of the pulpit. and did as he was told, standing in that place he had to<br>
bend his head a long way back just to see the priest. you are josef said the priest, and raised his hand<br>
from the balustrade to make a gesture whose meaning was unclear. yes, said he considered how freely<br>
he had always given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a burden to him, now there<br>
were people who knew his name whom he had never seen before, it had been so nice first to introduce<br>
yourself and only then for people to know who you were. you have been accused, said the priest,<br>
enabled to raise money on the goods of his creditors, the servant to pledge the property of his<br>
employer, and the idle or profligate mechanic to deposit his working tools, or his work in an unfinished<br>
slate. many persons in london are in the habit of pawning their apparel from monday morning till<br>
saturday night, when they are redeemed, in order to make a decent appearance on the next day, in low<br>
neighbourhoods, and among loose girls, much business is done by pawnbrokers to good advantage; and<br>
considerable emolument is derived from women of the town. the articles they offer to pledge are<br>
generally of the most costly nature, and the pilferings of the night are usually placed in the hands of<br>
uncle the next morning; and the wary money lenders, fully acquainted with their necessities, just<br>
lend what they please; by which means they derive a wonderful profit, from the almost certainty of<br>
these articles never being redeemed. the secresy with which a pawnbrokers business is conducted, though<br>
very proper for the protection of the honest and well meaning part of the population, to shield them<br>
from an exposure which might perhaps prove fatal to their business or credit, admits of great room for<br>
fraud on the part of the money lender; more particularly as it respects the interest allowed upon the</p>
