to the place, taking with him a bottle of wine mixed with a strong narcotic, when he arrived, he said<br>
that he was a priest, and, being afraid of robbers, wished to pass the night with some<br>
soldiers. the soldiers were glad to have with them, as they thought, a pious man, whose stories would inspire them<br>
to do good. after they had talked a while, zaragoza offered his bottle of wine to the soldiers, who<br>
freely drank from it. as was expected, they soon all fell asleep, and zaragoza succeeded in stealing the<br>
corpse of luis. he took it home and buried it in that same place where he had buried the head, the<br>
following morning the soldiers woke up, and were surprised to see that the priest and the corpse were<br>
gone. the king soon knew how his scheme had failed. then he thought of another plan. he ordered that<br>
a sheep covered with precious metal should be let loose in the streets, and that it should be followed by<br>
a spy, whose duty it was to watch from a distance, and, in case any one attempted to catch the sheep,<br>
to ascertain the house of that person, and then report to the palace. having received his orders, the spy<br>
let loose the sheep, and followed it at a distance. nobody else dared even to make a remark about the<br>
animal; but when zaragoza saw it, he drove it into his yard. the spy, following instructions, marked<br>
the door of zaragozas house with a cross, and hastened to the palace. the spy assured the soldiers that<br>
they would be able to capture the criminal; but when they began to look for the house, they found<br>
that all the houses were similarly marked with crosses. for the third time the king had failed; and,<br>
giving up all hopes of catching the thief, he issued a proclamation pardoning the man who had<br>
extraordinary battles between two known game on the pugilistic records. very heavy bets had been<br>
made upon it in all parts of the kingdom. one gentleman is said to have had five thousand pounds,<br>
and another one thousand eight hundred guineas. the gains of the conqueror were supposed to be about<br>
a thousand pounds. the amusements of the day were concluded by a second fight between parish and<br>
lashbroke, which proved a manly and determined contest for upwards of an hour, and in which the<br>
combatants evinced considerable skill and bravery, and was finally decided in favour of parish. all<br>
amusement which might have been derived from this spectacle, however, was completely destroyed by the<br>
daring outrages of an immense gang of pickpockets, who broke in the ring, and closed completely up<br>
to the ropes, carrying with them every person, of decent appearance, and openly robbing them of their<br>
watches, pocket books and purses, and the lateness of the hour, it being five oclock, and almost dark,<br>
favoured the depredators. in the midst of this struggle, tom dashall had nearly lost his fancy topper,<br>
and tallyho was secretly eased of his clicker. from the scene of tumult and confusion they were glad to<br>
escape; and being again safely seated in the topper a flash term given to a hat. clicker a flash term<br>
given to a watch, barouche, they made the best of their way home; in doing which, they found the<br>
roads almost as much cloggd as they were in the morning. the randallites were meritorious, and,<br>
flushed with good fortune, lined the public houses on the road to wet their whistles, singing and<br>
had not tasted food during all that time. in the evening they came to a cocoanut grove. here are some<br>
cocoanut trees, said one of them. let us get a bunch of cocoanuts and have something to eat as the<br>
eldest brother took off his camisa china and climbed up one of the trees, when he reached the top, the<br>
tree broke. bung down came the poor fellow. one cried the youngest brother. three more shouted the<br>
rest. dont come down until you have dropped four they all cried at once. who would answer them their<br>
brother lay dead on the ground, while they were waiting for the second bung the second brother climbed<br>
up the same tree. what had happened to the first happened also to him, and so to the third in turn.<br>
as the youngest brother heard the third fall, he thought of looking for his share. he crept about<br>
to find the cocoanuts. alas he discovered that his three brothers lay dead on the ground. he went away<br>
from the place crying very loud. now, his crying happened to disturb the palianac, who were trying to<br>
sleep. they went out to see what was the matter. when they found the poor helpless blind man, they<br>
were very much moved, and they gave him food and shelter for the night. they also gave him the tail<br>
of a paqui, which would help him find his fortune, they said. at daybreak they showed him the way<br>
out of the grove, the blind man walked on and on, until he was hailed by a lame man resting under a</pre>
