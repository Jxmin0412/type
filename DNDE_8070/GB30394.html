<p>home to tell his mother of hia success. when daubeny had first come to saint winifreds, he had been<br>
forced to go through very great persecution. as he sat down to do his work he would be pelted with<br>
orange peel, kicked, tilted off the form on which he sat, ridiculed, and sometimes chased out of the<br>
room. all this he had endured with admirable patience and good humour; in short, so patiently and<br>
good humouredly that all boys who had in them a spark of sense or honour very soon abandoned this<br>
system of torment, and made up for it as far as they could by respect and kindness, which always,<br>
however, took more or less the form of banter. it is not to be expected that boys will ever be made to<br>
see that steady, strenuous industry, even when it fails, is a greater and a better thing than idle<br>
cleverness, but those few who were so far in advance of their years as to have some intuition of this<br>
fact, felt for the character of daubeny, a value which gave him an influence of a rare and important<br>
kind. for nothing could daunt this young martyr not even failure itself. if he were too much bullied and<br>
annoyed to get up his lesson overnight, he would be up by five in the morning working at it with<br>
unremitting assiduity, very often he overdid it, and knew his lesson all the worse in proportion as he<br>
had spent upon it too great an amount of time. without being positively stupid, his intellect was<br>
somewhat dull, and as his manner was shy and awkward he had not been quite understood at first, and<br>
a master had taken him specially in hand to lighten his burdens. his bitterest trial, therefore, was to<br>
fail completely every now and then, and be reproached for it by some master who little knew the hours<br>
in your civilization. one man, beloved friends, who was not afraid to come forth from the masses, i<br>
have said before, if you think with the masses, believe with the masses, then you have lost your<br>
individuality. then you become one with the masses. seek the truth and stand by it, my children. use<br>
your intelligence. that is why your creator gave it to you. place no limitation upon yourself, but<br>
realize that you are this great power and intelligence that rules the universe. therefore, locked within<br>
you are the powers that shall manifest all that you need. you need only to unlock them through the<br>
love and understanding you are seeking, what, my friendo, do you think is the greatest power in the<br>
universe love is the greatest power, replied dorothy. you have spoken truly, my sister: love can<br>
accomplish anything, it is the force that permeates the universe. i say to you, beloved, love one<br>
another, for through this love shall you rise to great heights in understanding love one another. once<br>
this is established, the rest shall follow easily. understanding shall come in abundance; the waves of<br>
love shall follow understanding. can you see, my friends, why this is you see, when you have a great<br>
love in your consciousness, it opens wide the door for understanding, for wisdom, without love the door<br>
is locked. this is the power that permeates the universe. there is a great need for this upon the planet<br>
you call earth, for the lack of it has set up vibrations about your planet, encircling it. these vibrations<br>
are bringing about chaos, disturbances of nature itself, for so you think, as you are, whether it be as<br>
an individual, as a nation, or as a planet. do you have a slight understanding of what would happen<br>
been enviable. he could neither eat nor sleep. so he lay in bed at night, he kept his face covered with<br>
the clothes, dreading that if he peeped out into the corners. the phantom of the murdered horseman would<br>
beckon to him from the dark corners. lying so till the dawn broke and the cocks began to crow, he<br>
would then look cautiously forth, and seeing by the grey light that the corners were empty, and that<br>
the figure by the door was not the yew lane ghost, but his mothers faded print dress hanging on a<br>
nail, would drop his head and fall wearily asleep. the day was no better, for each hour brought him<br>
nearer to the next night school; and bessys illness made his mother so busy, that he never could find<br>
the right moment to ask her sympathy for his fears, and still less could he feel himself able to<br>
overcome them, and so the night school came round again, and there he sat, gulping down a few<br>
mouthfuls of food, and wondering how he should begin to tell his mother that he neither dare, could,<br>
nor would, go down yer lane again at night, he had just opened his lips when the father came in, and<br>
asked in a loud voice why bill was not off. this effectually put a stop to any confidences, and the boy<br>
ran out of the house. not, however, to school. he made one or two desperate efforts at determination,</p>
