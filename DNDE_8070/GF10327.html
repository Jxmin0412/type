them that spoils divide our pilgrim fathers accepted these absurd, tautological verses gladly, and sang<br>
them gratefully; but we know the spirit of poesy could never have existed in them, else they would have<br>
fought hard against abandoning such majestic psalms as sternholds the lord descended from above and<br>
bond the heavens hye and underneath his feete he cast the darkness of the skye. on cherubs and<br>
cherubines full royally he road and on the winges of all the windes came flying all abroad. they gave<br>
up these lines of simple grandeur, to which they were accustomed, for such wretched verses as these of<br>
the new england version: likewise the heavens he downe bond and he descended, & there was under his<br>
it, and he felt as lonely and as miserable as in that night. but now a shadow appeared before the<br>
opening of the cave, and he breathed a deep sigh as he felt himself released from the hideous vision,<br>
for he had recognized paulus, who came up and knelt down beside him. water, water stephanus<br>
implored in a low voice, and paulus, who was cut to the heart by the moaning of the old man, which<br>
he had not heard till he entered the cave, seized the pitcher. he looked into it, and, finding it quite dry,<br>
he rushed down to the spring as if he were running for a wager, filled it to the brim and brought it to<br>
the lips of the sick man, who gulped the grateful drink down with deep draughts, and at last exclaimed<br>
with a sigh of relief; that is better; why were you so long away i was so thirsty paulus who had fallen<br>
again on his knees by the old man, pressed his brown against the couch, and made no reply. stephanus<br>
gazed in astonishment at his companion, but perceiving that he was weeping passionately he asked no<br>
further questions. perfect stillness reigned in the cave for about an hour; at last paulus raised his face,<br>
and said, forgive me stephanus. i forgot your necessity in prayer and scourging, in order to recover<br>
peace of mind i had trifled away as a heathen would have done such a thing the sick man stroked his<br>
friends arm affectionately; but paulus murmured, egoism, miserable egoism guides and governs us.<br>
which of us ever thinks of the needs of others and we we who profess to walk in the way of the lamb<br>
he sighed deeply, and leaned his head on the sick mans breast, who lovingly stroked his rough hair,<br>
and it was thus that the senator found him, when he entered the cave with hermas. the idle way of life<br>
captain morgan inquired for any banditti from panama or puerto bello, and three were brought him,<br>
who pretended to be very expert in the avenues of those parts. he asked them to be his guides, and<br>
show him the securest ways to panama, which, if they performed, he promised them equal shares in the<br>
plunder of that expedition, and their liberty when they arrived in jamaica. these propositions the<br>
banditti readily accepted, promising to serve him very faithfully, especially one of the three, who was<br>
the greatest rogue, thief, and assassin among them, who had deserved rather to be broken alive on the<br>
wheel, than punished with serving in a garrison. this wicked fellow had a great ascendant over the<br>
other two, and domineered over them as he pleased, they not daring to disobey his orders. captain<br>
morgan commanded four ships and one boat to be equipped, and provided with necessaries, to go and<br>
take the castle of chagre, on the river of that name; neither would he go himself with his whole fleet,<br>
lest the spaniards should be jealous of his farther design on panama. in these vessels he embarked four<br>
hundred men, to put in execution these his orders. meanwhile, himself remained in st. catherines with<br>
the rest of the fleet, expecting to hear of their success. captain morgan takes the castle of chagre, with<br>
