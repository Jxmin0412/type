<p>PAGE 0315<br>herr matanesse san meer as a burymasters house, he went to young wibismas aunt to get his cloak, which had<br>not been returned to him. he did not usually give much heed to his dress, yet he was glad that the rain<br>kept people in the house, for the outgrown wrap on his shoulders was by no means pleasing in<br>appearance. wilhelm must certainly have looked anything but well clad, for as he stood in old fraulein<br>van hoogstratens spacious, stately hall, the steward belotti received him as patronizingly as if he were<br>a beggar. but the neopolitan, in whose mouth the vigorous dutch sounded like the rattling in the<br>throat of a chilled singer, speedily took a different tone when wilhelm, in excellent italian, quietly<br>explained the object of his visit. nay, at the sweet accents of his native tongue, the servants repellent<br>demeanor melted into friendly, eager welcome. he was beginning to speak of his home to wilhelm, but<br>the musician made him curt replies and asked him to get his cloak. belotti now led him courteously<br>into a small room at the side of the great hall, took off his cloak, and then went upstairs. as a minule<br>after minute passed, until at last a whole quarter of an hour elapsed, and neither servant nor<br>appeared, the young man lost his patience, though it was not easily disturbed, and when the door at<br>last opened serious peril threatened the leaden panes on which he was drumming loudly with his<br>fingers, wilhelm doubtless heard it, yet he drummed with redoubled vehemence, to show the italian that<br>herself by his side in rich though unpretending splendor. she pictured herself with her son and daughter<br>enjoying a new, estate, freed from debt and increased by anis generosity, and then a<br>intoxicating hope came into her mind. perhaps aheady at this moment her daughter was a widow, and<br>why should she not be so fortunate as to induce ani to select her child, the prettiest woman in thebes,<br>for his wife then she, the mother of the queen, would be indeed unimpeachable, and all powerful. she<br>had long since come to regard the pioneer as a tool to be cast aside, nay son to be utterly destroyed;<br>his wealth might probably at some future time be bestowed upon her son, who had distinguished<br>himself at kadesh, and whom ani must before long promote to be his charioteer or the commander of<br>the chariot warriors. flattered by these fancies, she forgot every, she walked faster and faster to<br>and fro in her tent. suddenly the steward, whom she had this time sent to the very scene of the fire,<br>rushed into the tent, and with every token of terror broke to her the news that the king and his<br>charioteer were hanging in mid air on a narrow wooden parapet, and that unless some miracle<br>happened they must inevitably be killed. it was said that incendiaries had occasioned the fire, and he,<br>the steward, had hastened forward to prepare her for evil news as the mangled body of the pioneer,<br>which had been identified by the ring on his finger, and the poor little corpse of nemu, pierced through<br>by an arrow, had been carried past him. katuti was silent for a moment, and the kings sons she asked<br>opportunities of indulging in such details when we meet, replete as i can assure you they are with<br>interest. i have written instructions to my agent in town for the immediate disposal of my paternal<br>estate in wiltshire, and mean hereafter to take up my abode on a care i have recently purchased in the<br>neighbourhood of belville hall, where i anticipate many pleasurable opportunities of seeing you and our<br>friend tallyho surrounding my hospitable and hereafter family board. we shall be there within a month,<br>as we mean to reach our place of destination by easy stages, and look about us. please remember me<br>to all old friends in town, and believe as ever, yours truly, charles sparkle. carlisle. the receipt of this<br>letter and its contents were immediately communicated to young mortimer, who had already received<br>some intelligence of a similar nature, which had the effect of allaying apprehension and dismissing fear<br>for his sisters safety. the mysterious circumstances were at once explained, and harmony was restored<br>to the previously agitated family. i am truly glad of this information, said tom, and as we are at<br>present likely to be politically engaged, we cannot do less than take a bumper or two after dinner, to<br>the health and happiness of the candidate who so emphatically observes, he has gained his election,<br>and, in the true language of every patriot, declares he is the happiest man alive, notwithstanding the<br>rivets by which he is bound. you are inclined to be severe, said tallyho. by no means, replied dashall;<br>the language of the letter certainly seems a little in consonance with my observation, but i am sincere</p>
