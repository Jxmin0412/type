no color, but her eyes shone with a gentler and purer light which glorified the severe beauty of her<br>
features. as the girl approached the captain he fixed his eyes on her, and called out: hey pale face are<br>
you a christian yes, my lord, replied selene, and she went on quietly and indifferently with her brother.<br>
the roman looked after her, and as she passed by hadrians statue, and, as she did so, dropped her<br>
head rather lower than before, he roughly ordered her to stop and to tell him why she had averted her<br>
face from the statue of caesar. hadrian is our ruler as well as yours, answered the young girl. i am in<br>
haste for there are sick people on the island. you will bring them no good cried the beggar. who knows<br>
what is hidden there in the basket silence interrupted the tribune. they say, girl that your fellow<br>
believers overthrew the statue of caesar in the night. how should that be we honor caesar no less than<br>
you do. i will believe you, and you shall prove it. there stands the statue of the divine caesar.<br>
come and worship it. selene looked with horror in the face of the stern roman and could not find a<br>
word of reply, well asked the captain, will you come or no yes or no selene struggled for self possession, and<br>
when the soldier held out his hand to her she said with a trembling voice: we honor the emperor we<br>
pray to no statue only to our father in heaven. there you have it laughed the beggar. once more i ask<br>
you, cried the tribune. will you worship this statue, or do you refuse to do so a fearful struggle<br>
possessed selenes soul. if she resisted the roman her life was in danger, and the fury of the populace<br>
would be aroused against her fellow believers if, on the other hand, she obeyed him, she would be<br>
blaspheming god, breaking her faith to the saviour who loved her, sinning against the truth and her<br>
the prisoners had passed them, and the drivers were exchanging greetings with the out posts, a girl, in<br>
the long robe of an egyptian, came towards them, and looked at them. pentaur started as if he had<br>
seen a ghost; but nebsecht gave expression to his astonishment in a loud cry, at the same instant a<br>
driver laid his whip across their shoulders, and cried laughing: you may hit each other as hard as you<br>
like with words, but not with your hands. then he turned to his companions, and said: did you see the<br>
pretty girl there, in front of the tent it is nothing to me he addressed. she belongs to<br>
the princesss train. she has been three weeks here on a visit to the holy shrine of hathor. she must<br>
have commilled some heavy sin, replied the other. if she were one of us, she would have been set to sift<br>
sand in the diggings, or grind colors, and not be living here in a gilt tent, where is our red beard<br>
uardas father had lingered a little behind the party, for the girl had signed to him, and exchanged a<br>
few words with him. have you still an eye for the fair one asked the youngest of the drivers when he<br>
rejoined the gang. she is a waiting maid of the princess, replied the soldier not without embarrassment.<br>
to morrow morning we are to carry a letter from her to the scribe of the mines, and if we encamp in<br>
the neighborhood she will send us some wine for carrying it. the old red beard scents wine as a fox a<br>
goose. let us encamp here; one never knows what may be picked up among the mentu, and the<br>
superintendent said we were to encamp outside the casis. put down your sacks, men here there is fresh<br>
water, and perhaps a few dates and sweet manna for you to eat with it. manna is the name still given by<br>
the bedouins of sinai to the sweet gum which exudes from the tamarix mannifera. it is the result of the<br>
puncture of an insect, and occurs chiefly in may. by many it is supposed to be the manna of the bible.<br>
good parson sat by her bedside, and read to her of the coming of the bridegroom, and of that fine linen<br>
clean and white, which is the righteousness of the saints. it was of that drawer, with its lavender and<br>
potpourri bags, that the scented smoke had reminded her. it has rather an overpowering odour, said the<br>
old parson; it is suggestive of incense. i never smelt something like it in the church of the<br>
nativity at bethlehem. it is very delicious, the parsons long residence in his parish had been marked by<br>
one great holiday. with the savings of many years he had performed a pilgrimage to the holy land;<br>
and it was rather a joke against him that he illustrated a large variety of subjects by reference to his<br>
favourite topic, the holiday of his life. it smells of gunpowder, said jim, decidedly, and something else. i<br>
cant tell what. something one smells in a seaport town, said tom. cant be very delicious then, jim<br>
retorted. its not quite the same, piped the widow; but it reminds me very much of an old bottle of attar</p>
