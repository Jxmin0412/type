leller received to day again taught her that her anticipations were not realized. he had been a faithful<br>
friend of her father, now numbered with the dead. her brother in law too had attached himself, with all<br>
the enthusiasm of youth, to the older, fully matured champion of liberty, van der werff. when he had<br>
spoken of peter to maria, it was always with expressions of the warmest admiration and love. peter had<br>
come to delft soon after her fathers death and the violent end of the young wedded pair, and when he<br>
expressed his sympathy and strove to comfort her, did so in strong, tender words, to which she could<br>
cling, as if to an anchor, in the misery of her heart. the valiant citizen of leyden came to delft<br>
more frequently, and was always a guest at doctor groots house. when the men were engaged in<br>
consultation, maria was permilled to fill their glasses and be present at their conferences. words flew to<br>
and fro and often seemed to her neither clear nor wise; but what van der werff said was always sensible,<br>
a child could understand his plain, vigorous speech. he appeared to the young girl like an oak<br>
tree among swaying willows. she knew of many of his journeys, undertaken at the peril of his life, in<br>
the service of the prince and his native land, and awaited their result with a throbbing heart. once<br>
in those days, the thought had entered her mind that it would be delightful to be borne<br>
through life in the strong arms of this steadfast man. then he extended these arms, and she yielded to<br>
his wish as proudly and happily as a squire summoned by the king to be made a knight. she now<br>
remembered this by gone time, and every hope with which she had accompanied him to leyden rose<br>
vividly before her soul. her newly wedded husband had promised her a spring, but a pleasant summer<br>
retreat, resting themselves till night. this being come, they returned to the assault, to try, by the help<br>
of their fire balls, to destroy the pales before the wall; and while they were about it, there happened a<br>
very remarkable accident, which occasioned their victory. one of the pirates being wounded with an<br>
arrow in his back, which pierced his body through, he pulled it out boldly at the side of his breast,<br>
and winding a little cotton about it, he put it into his musket, and shot it back to the castle; but the<br>
cotton being kindled by the powder, fired two or three houses in the castle, being thatched with palm<br>
leaves, which the spaniards perceived not so soon as necessary; for this fire meeting with a parcel<br>
of powder, blew it up, thereby causing great win, and no less consternation to the spaniards, who were<br>
not able to put a stop to it, not having seen it time enough. the pirates perceiving the effect of the<br>
arrow, and the misfortunes of the spaniards, were infinitely glad; and while they were busied in<br>
quenching the fire, which caused a great confusion for want of water, the pirates took this opportunity,<br>
setting fire likewise to the palisades. the fire thus once in several parts about the castle, gave<br>
them great advantage against the spaniards, many breaches being made by the fire among the pales,<br>
great heaps of earth falling into the ditch, then the pirates climbing up, got over into the castle,<br>
though those spaniards, who were not busy about the fire, cast down many flaming pols full of<br>
combustible matter, and odious smells, which destroyed many of the english. the spaniards, with all<br>
their resistance, could not hinder the palisades from being burnt down before midnight. meanwhile the<br>
pirates continued in their intention of taking the castle; and though the fire was very great, they would<br>
animal kill another. it seems more natural, and fairer. they have a run for their lives, so to speak, and<br>
who did you get to kill your mouse well, i know a youngster who has a terrier, they are a perfect pair.<br>
like two peas, and equally keen about sport they would go twenty miles to chase a bluebottle<br>
sooner than not hunt something. so i told him there was a mouse de trop in my rooms, and<br>
and he promised to bring nipper next morning. i was going out hunting myself. the meet was early,<br>
and my man got breakfast at seven oclock for me in my own quarters; and the first thing i saw when i<br>
came out of my bedroom was the mouse sitting on the edge of my indian silver sugar basin. i knese<br>
him again by his ears, and there he sat all breakfast time, twitching his tail, and nibbling little bits of<br>
sugar, and watching me with such a pair of eyes have you ever seen a mouses eyes close upon my<br>
word, they are wonderfully beautiful, and its uncommonly difficult to hurt a creature with fine eyes. i<br>
didnt touch it, and as i was going out i looked back, and the mouse was looking after me. i was a fool</p>
