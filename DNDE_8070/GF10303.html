dickeys, michael basermans, jacob millers, samuel millers, daniel millers, abraham millers. friday, may,<br>
after dinner, they go to lima and wait for the train, which does not come in till ten oclock at night. it<br>
had run off the track near a place called forest, the diary note says: a man was killed here by the<br>
western train while we were waiting, he got between the woodpile and the cars. death overtook him<br>
without a moments warning. if unprepared to die, how sad the thought of his being launched into the<br>
eternal deeps of misery and despair my eyes often turn with sorrow to the hopeless condition of those<br>
who live without god in the world. how men and women of common sense can be satisfied to live year in<br>
and year out, on the verge of ruin, is a mystery to me.. a glow of enthusiasm often enters my soul, in<br>
my conscience, and as to the girl, i will take her in hand. will it not be possible for theophilus to grant me<br>
an interview hardly, at present, replied the priest. as you know, cynegius is here and the fate of the<br>
bishop and of our cause hangs on the next few days, give up your ambitious desires i beseech you,<br>
daughter, for even if theophilus were to admit you i firmly believe, nay do not be angry i can but hope<br>
that he would never give way on this point. no said the widow looking down in some embarrassment;<br>
but when her visitor was gone she lifted her head with a flash of wilful defiance, she then made marcus,<br>
who had on the previous day given her a full account of his voyage from rome, tell her all that had<br>
passed between himself and demetrius; she asked him how he liked his horse, whether he hoped to win<br>
the approaching races, and generally what he had been doing and was going to do. but it did not<br>
escape her notice that marcus was more reticent than usual and that he tried to bring the conversation<br>
round to his voyage and to the guests in the xenodochium; however, she always stopped him, for she<br>
knew what he was aiming at and would not listen to anything on that subject. it was not till long<br>
after the slaves had lighted the three branched silver lamps that demetrius appeared. his stepmother<br>
received him kindly and began to talk on indifferent subjects; but he replied with ill disguised<br>
impatience, for he had not come to chatter and gossip. she fully understood this; but it pleased her to<br>
check and provoke him and she did it in a way which vividly reminded him of his early days, of the<br>
desolation and unhappiness that had blighted his young life when this woman had taken the place of<br>
church folk, who ordered that if any boye shall be taken playing or misbehaving himself in the time of<br>
publick worship whether in the meeting house or about the walls he shall be examined and punished at<br>
the present publickly before the assembly depart. parson chauncey, of durham, when a boy misbehaved<br>
in meeting, and was punched up by the tithingman, often stopped in his sermon, called the godless<br>
young offender by name, and asked him to come to the parsonage the next day. some very lender and<br>
beautiful lessons were taught to these durham boys at these monday morning interviews, and have<br>
descended to us in tradition; and the good mr. chauncey stands out a shining light of christian patience<br>
and forbearance at a time when every other new england minister, from john cotton down, preached and<br>
practised the stern repression and sharp correction of all children, and chanted together in solemn<br>
chorus, foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child. one vicious tithingman invented, and was<br>
allowed to exercise on the boys, a punishment which was the refinement of cruelty. he walked up to the<br>
laughing, sporting, or whittling boy, took him by the collar or the cars, led him ostentatiously across<br>
the meeting house, and seated him by his shamefaced mother on the womens side. it was as if one</p>
