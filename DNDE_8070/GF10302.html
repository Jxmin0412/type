<p>many of ye boyes as may be convenient, and if any are unruly, to present their names, as the law<br>
directs. nowadays we should hardly seat boys in a group if we wished them to be orderly and decorous,<br>
and i fear the man by the name of guppy found it no easy task to preserve order and due gravity<br>
among the purilan boys in salem meeting, in fact, the rampant boys behaved thus badly for the very<br>
reason that they were seated together instead of with their respective families; and not until the fashion<br>
was universal of each family sitting in a pew or group by itself did the boys in meeting behave like<br>
human beings rather than like mischievous and unruly monkeys. in stratford, in, a lithingman was<br>
appointed to watch over the youths of disorderly carriage, and see that they behave themselves comelie,<br>
and use such raps and blows as in his discretion meet. i like to think of those rows of sober faced<br>
puritan boys seated on the narrow, steep pulpit stairs, clad in knee breeches and homespun flapped<br>
coats, and with round, cropped heads, miniature likenesses in dress and countenance if not in<br>
deportment of their grave, stern, god fearing fathers. though they were of the sedate puritan blood,<br>
they were boys, and they wriggled and twisted, and scraped their feet noisily on the sanded floor; and i<br>
know full well that the square toed shoes of one in whom original sin waxed powerful, thrust many a<br>
sly dig in the ribs and back of the luckless wight who chanced to sit in front of and below him on the<br>
pulpit stairs. many a dried kernel of indian corn was surreptitiously snapped at the head of an unwary<br>
neighbor, and many a sly word was whispered and many a furtive but audible snicker elicited when the<br>
to my taste, now, to bring my text to something like a practical head, i must say to every unconverted<br>
soul here: you must put the salt into the water of gods word for yourself. if you look to the lord, and<br>
ask him to give you eyes that you may see, and ears that you may hear, and a heart that you may<br>
understand, you will also receive all the salt you need to heal the word and make it healing to your<br>
soul. but if you neglect and despise or reject the offers of gods love, the very thing that he has<br>
prepared for your eternal joy will be everlasting bitterness to your soul. for one to know his duty and<br>
not at the same time do it exposes him to the danger of being converted into a pillar of bitter salt as<br>
lots wife was. she could not give up her love for the world. she knew that she must not look back with<br>
longings for the sodom of the sinful life she had left; but she did look back, and her awful fate is<br>
brought to mind by our lord as a warning to all: remember lots wife. by the words of my text, then,<br>
the lord meant that the disciples represented the charity and faith that sweeten and give to every word<br>
of divine truth a gracious reception into the heart and life. in this happy love the christian sings of the<br>
word of life in the beautiful sentiment of an old hymn: yes, thou art precious to my soul; my transport<br>
and my trust: jewels to thee are gaudy toys, and gold is sordid dust. and when the disembodied soul<br>
shall awake to the full realization of the truth which shone so dimly here, the love for that truth will<br>
be sevenfold as the light of seven days all in one, which means fullness of joy and pleasures<br>
forevermore. sunday, september this day brother solomon garber leaves me after meeting, to attend to<br>
appointments ahead. i stay to debate with a methodist preacher. in the afternoon i baptize sister<br>
to my taste, now, to bring my text to something like a practical head, i must say to every unconverted<br>
soul here: you must put the salt into the water of gods word for yourself. if you look to the lord, and<br>
