the present be informed of his true origin. he is a strangely constituted man, said ameni, and he is not<br>
incapable of playing us some unforeseen trick before he has done his part, if he is told who he is. the<br>
storm had exhausted itself, and the sky, though covered still with torn and flying clouds, cleared by<br>
degrees, as the morning went on; a sharp coolness succeeded the hot blast, but the sun as il mounted<br>
higher and higher soon heated the air. on the roads and in the gardens lay uprooted trees and many<br>
slightly built houses which had been blown down, while the tents in the strangers quarter, and<br>
hundreds of light palm thatched roofs, had been swept away. the regent was returning to thebes, and<br>
with him went ameni, who desired to ascertain by his own eyes what mischief the whirlwind had done to<br>
his garden in the city. on the nile they met paakers boat, and ani caused it and his own to be stopped,<br>
while he requested paaker to visit him shortly at the palace. the high priests garden was in no respect<br>
inferior in beauty and extent to that of the mohar, the ground had belonged to his family from the<br>
remotest generations, and his house was large and magnificent. he seated himself in a shady arbor, to<br>
take a repast with his still handsome wife and his young and pretty daughters. he consoled his wife for<br>
the various damage done by the hurricane, promised the girls to build a new and handsomer clove cot<br>
in the place of the one which had been blown down, and laughed and joked with them all; for here the<br>
voyages in distant lands. the nile voyage came to an end at thebes of the hundred gates, and here<br>
nothing that could attract the roman travellers remained unvisited, the tombs of the pharaohs<br>
extending into the very heart of the rocky hills, and the grand temples that stood to the west of the<br>
city of the dead, shorn though they were of their ancient glory, filled the emperor with admiration. the<br>
imperial travellers and their companions listened to the famous colossus of memnon, of which the upper<br>
portion had been overthrown by an earthquake, and three times in the dawn they heard it sound.<br>
balbilla described the incident in several long poems which sabina caused to be engraved on the stone<br>
of the colossus. the poetess imagined herself as hearing the voice of memnon singing to his mother<br>
while her tears, the fresh morning dew, fell upon the image of her son, fallen before the walls of troy.<br>
these verses she composed in the acclian dialect, named herself as their writer and informed the readers<br>
among whom she included pontius that she was descended from a house no less noble than that of king<br>
antiochus, the gigantic structures on each bank of the nile fully equalled hadrians expectations,<br>
though they had suffered so much injury from earthquakes and sieges, and the impoverished priesthood<br>
grandsire triples in two hours and fifty nine minutes. there was a little cask of bulteels brightest<br>
tenpenny that some magicians had conjured up through the well hole in the belfry floor: and clerk<br>
janaway, for all he was teetotaler, eyed the foaming pots wistfully as he passed them round after the<br>
work was done. well, he said, there werent no intrupted peal this time, were there these here old bells<br>
never had a finer set of ringing one under them, and i lay you never had a finer set of bells above<br>
your heads, my lads; now did ee ive heard the bells swung many a time in carisbury lower, and heard<br>
em when the queen was set upon her throne, but, for they arnt so deep like as yet<br>
here old ring. perhaps theyre grond the sweeter for lying by a bit, like port in the cellars of the<br>
blandamer arms, though ive heard dr ennefer say some of it was turned so like sherry, that no<br>
living couldnt tell the difference. westray had bowed like loyal subaltern to the verdict of his chief. sir<br>
georges decision that the bells might safely be rung lifted the responsibility from the young mans<br>
shoulders, but not the anxiety from his mind. he never left the church while the peal was ringing. first<br>
he was in the bell chamber steadying himself by the beams of the cage, while he marked the wide<br>
mouthed bells ran open heavenwards, now turn back with a sweet rush into the darkness below. then he crept<br>
deafened with the clangour down the stairs into the belfry, and sat on the sill of a window watching the<br>
zingers rise and fall at their work. he felt the tower sway restlessly under the stress of the swinging<br>
metal, but there was nothing unusual in the motion; there was no falling of mortar, nothing to attract<br>
any special attention, then he went down into the church, and up again into the organ loft, whence he<br>
could see the wide bow of that late norman arch which spanned the south transept. above the arch ran</p>
