voyages in distant lands. the nile voyage came to an end at thebes of the hundred gates, and here<br>
nothing that could attract the roman travellers remained unvisited. the tombs of the pharaohs<br>
extending into the very heart of the rocky hills, and the grand temples that stood to the west of the<br>
city of the dead, shorn though they were of their ancient glory, filled the emperor with admiration. the<br>
imperial travellers and their companions listened to the famous colossus of memnon, of which the upper<br>
portion had been overthrown by an earthquake, and three times in the dawn they heard it sound.<br>
balbilla described the incident in several long poems which sabina caused to be engraved on the stone<br>
of the colossus. the poetess imagined herself as hearing the voice of memnon singing to his mother<br>
while her tears, the fresh morning dew, fell upon the image of her son, fallen before the walls of troy.<br>
she composed in the acclian dialect, named herself as their writer and informed the readers<br>
among whom she included pontius that she was descended from a house on less noble than that of king<br>
antiochus, the gigantic structures on each bank of the nile fully equalled hadrians expectations,<br>
though they had suffered so much injury from earthquakes and sieges, and the impoverished priesthood<br>
of thebes were no longer in a position to provide for their preservation even, much less for their<br>
restoration. balbilla accompanied caesar on a visit to the sanctuary of ammon, on the eastern shore of<br>
the nile. in the great hall, the most vast and lofty pillared hall in the world, her impressionable soul<br>
felt a peculiar exaltation, and as the emperor observed how, with a heightened color she now gazed<br>
cruelly, that the miserable wretch gave up the ghost, with these dying words: i beseech the almighty<br>
god, creator of heaven and earth, that he permit the wicked spirit to make thee feel as many torments<br>
before thy death, as thou hast caused me to feel before mine. a strange thing, and worthy of<br>
astonishment and admiration scarce three or four days were past, after this horrible fact, when the<br>
almighty judge, who had heard the cries of the tormented wretch, suffered the evil one suddenly to<br>
possess this barbarous and inhuman homicide, so that those cruel hands which had punished to death<br>
his innocent servant, were the tormentors of his own body: for he beat himself and tore his flesh, after<br>
a miserable manner, till he lost the very shape of a man not ceasing to howl and cry, without any<br>
rest by day or night. thus he continued raving mad, till he died. many other examples of this kind i<br>
could rehearse; but these not belonging to our present discourse, i omit them, the planters of the<br>
caribbee islands are rather worse, and more cruel to their servants, than the former. in the isle of st.<br>
christopher dwells one named bettesa, well known to the dutch merchants, who has killed above a<br>
hundred of his servants with blows and stripes. the english do the same with their servants; and the<br>
mildest cruelty they exercise towards them is, that when they have served six years of their time they<br>
being bound among the english for seven years they use them so cruelly, as to force them to beg of their<br>
masters to sell them to others, though it be to begin another servitude of seven years, or at least three<br>
or four, and i have known many, who have thus served fifteen or twenty years, before they could obtain<br>
the present be informed of his true origin. he is a strangely constituted man, said ameni, and he is not<br>
incapable of playing us some unforeseen trick before he has done his part, if he is told who he is. the<br>
storm had exhausted itself, and the sky, though covered still with torn and flying clouds, cleared by<br>
degrees, as the morning went on; a sharp coolness succeeded the hot blast, but the sun as il mounted<br>
higher and higher on heated the air. on the roads and in the gardens lay uprooted trees and many<br>
slightly built houses which had been blown down, while the tents in the strangers quarter, and<br>
hundreds of light palm thatched roofs, had been swept away. the regent was returning to thebes, and<br>
with him went ameni, who desired to ascertain by his own eyes what mischief the whirlwind had done to<br>
his garden in the city. on the nile they met paakers boat, and ani caused it and his own to be stopped,<br>
while he requested paaker to visit him Shortly at the palace. the high priests garden was in no respect<br>
inferior in beauty and extent to that of the mohar. the ground had belonged to his family from the<br>
remotest generations, and his house was large and magnificent. he seated himself in a shady arbor, to<br>
take a repast with his still handsome wife and his young and pretty daughters. he consoled his wife for</p>
