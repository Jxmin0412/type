together it is recorded of rev. urian cakes that often the hour glass was turned four times during one of<br>
his sermons. the warning legend, be short, which cotton mather inscribed over his study door was not<br>
written over his pulpit; for he wrote in his disry that at his own ordination he prayed for an hour and<br>
a quarter, and preached for an hour and three quarters. added to the other ordination exercises these<br>
long mather addresses must have been tiresome enough. nathaniel ward deplored at that time, wee have<br>
a strong weakness in new england that when wee are speaking, we know not how to conclude: wee<br>
make many ends before wee make an end. dr. lord of norwich always made a prayer which was one<br>
hour long; and an early dutch traveller who visited new england asserted that he had heard there on<br>
a fast day a prayer which was two hours long. these long prayers were universal and most highly<br>
esteemed, a poor gift in prayer being a most deplored and even despised clerical short coming. had not<br>
the puritans left the church of england to escape stinted prayers whitefield prayed openly for parson<br>
barrett of hopkinton, who could pray neither freely, nor well, that god would open this dumb dogs<br>
mouth; and everywhere in the puritan church, precatory eloquence as evinced in long prayers was felt to<br>
be the greatest glory of the minister, and the highest tribute to god. in nearly all the churches the<br>
assembled people stood during prayer time since kneeling and bowing the head savored of romish<br>

much, to his exertions and had great pleasure in expressing her obligations. he was aware, of course,<br>
that the property he had been managing had been purchased originally partly with her fortune and<br>
partly out of her husbands pocket, and that half of it was therefore hers and half of it the property of<br>
marcus and himself; but that by her husbands will the control and management were hers absolutely.<br>
she had endeavored to carry out the intentions of her deceased husband by entrusting the stewardship<br>
of the estate to demetrius while he was still quite young; under his care the income had increased, and<br>
she had no doubt that in the future he might achieve even greater results; at the same time, the<br>
misunderstandings that the whole business had given rise to were not to be endured, and must<br>
positively be put an end to, even if their income were to diminish by half. i, she exclaimed, am a<br>
christian, with my whole heart and soul. i have dedicated my body and life to the service of my<br>
saviour. what shall all the treasures of the world profit me if i lose my soul; and that, which is my<br>
immortal part, must inevitably perish if i allow my pockets to be filled by the toil of heathen peasants<br>
and slaves. i therefore must insist and on this point i will not yield a jot that our slaves in cyrenaica,<br>
a flock of more than three thousand erring sheep, shall either submit to be baptized or be removed to<br>
make way for christians, that is to say began demetrius hastily. i have not yet done, she interrupted.<br>

and writhe about in the air, while at a second glance the spectators began to realise the fact that all<br>
around, gliding in and out amongst the stones, were hundreds upon hundreds more of the reptiles,<br>
apparently urged on by some savage instinct to form other knots, till the whole of the hollow in front<br>
seemed to be alive with the loathsome creatures. did you ever see anything like this before, griggs said<br>
the doctor, who was the first to speak, never, sir; but an old gold prospector once told me that he had<br>
seen just such a sight, only i put it down to being a yarn told to me. but theyre not poisonous<br>
not rattlesnakes, surely said bourne, they surely are, cried wilton. hark cant you hear its like a dull<br>
thrilling sound. here, i dont want to be the first to run, but i cant stand this; im off. wed better all be<br>
off, cried the doctor. here, griggs, head round your bell mule and lets get away. you seem to have led<br>
us right into the empire of snakes. quick, look alive, or the poor brutes will be right amongst the<br>
reptiles. not they, sir; they smell em and help, or we shall have a stampede. twelve. chris<br>
