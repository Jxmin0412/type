punch and judy the amount of pillow their two noses took up i shall never forget, and the old doll that<br>
had nothing on, because her clothes were in the dolls wash and did not get ironed on saturday night,<br>
and the highlander, whose things wouldnt come off, and who slept in his kilt. not bear you nonsense<br>
you must go to bed, my dear. ive got other things to do, and i cant leave you lying about. the whole<br>
lot of you did not weigh one quarter of what i do, i cried desperately. i cannot and will not get into<br>
that bed; i should break it all to pieces, and hurt myself into the bargain, well, if you will not go to<br>
bed i must put you there, said rosa, and without more ado, she snatched me up in her arms, and laid<br>
me down. of course it was just as i expected. i had hardly touched the two little pillows they had a<br>
meal baggy smell from being stuffed with bran, when the woodwork gave way with a crash, and i fell<br>
fell fell though i fully believed every bone in my body to be broken, it was really a relief to get to the<br>
ground. as soon as i could, i sat up, and felt myself all over. i was a little stiff, but, as it seemed, unhurt.<br>
oddly enough, i found that i was back again under the tree; and more strange still, it was not the tree<br>
where i sat with rosa, but the old oak tree in the little wood. was it all a dream the toys had vanished,<br>
the lights were out, the mosses looked dull in the growing dusk, the evening was chilly, the hole in<br>
my nose larger than it was thirty years ago, and when i felt in my pocket for my spectacles i found that they<br>
were on my nose. i have returned to the spot many times since, but i never could induce rosa to enter<br>
into conversation on the subject, the hole remains obstinately impassable, and i have not been<br>

regent bowed, and then asked: do you propose to obey the demand of the pharaoh without delay he is<br>
the king, our council, which will meet in a few days, can only determine how, and not whether we shall<br>
fulfil his command. you will retard the departure of the serfs, and rameses requires them at once. the<br>
bloody labor of the war demands new tools. and the peace will perhaps demand a new master, who<br>
understands how to employ the sons of the land to its greatest advantage a genuine son of the<br>
regent stood opposite the high priest, motionless as an image cast in bronze, and remained silent; but<br>
ameni lowered his staff before him as before a god, and then went into the fore part of the hall. when<br>
ani followed him, a soft smile played as usual upon his countenance, and full of dignity he took his<br>
seat on the throne. art thou at an end of thy communications he asked the high priest. it remains for<br>
me to inform you all, replied ameni with a louder voice, to be heard by all the assembled dignitaries,<br>
that the princess bent anat yesterday morning committed a heavy sin, and that in all the temples in<br>
the land the gods shall be entreated with offerings to take her uncleanness from her. again a shadow<br>
passed over the smile on the regents countenance. he looked meditatively on the ground, and then said:<br>
to morrow i will visit the house of seti; till then i beg that this affair may be left to rest. ameni bowed,<br>
to put on my jersey. never mind, youll only want your cap and belt, and can play in your shirt sleeves.<br>
number two; so cut along, said henderson, and get your belt. well wait for you here. there goes<br>
walter with why, the eternal friends getting as wasted with misery as the daughter of babylon, said henderson,<br>
as walter ran off. yes, said kenrick. i dont like to see that glum lock instead of the merry face he<br>
with. never mind; the gamell do him good; i never saw such a player; he looks just like the british lion<br>
when he gets into the middle of the fray; plunges at everything, and shakes his mane.. here he is; come<br>
along, they ran up and found a hotly contested game swaying to and fro between the goals; and<br>
walter, who was very active and a first rate runner, was soon in the thick of it. as the evenness of the<br>
match grew more apparent the players got more and more excited. it had been already played several<br>
times, and no base had been kicked, except once by each side, when the scale had been turned by a<br>
heavy wind. hence they exhibited the greatest eagerness, and school and sixth alike held it a strong<br>
point of honour to win, and a shout of approval greeted any successful catch or vigorous kick.<br>
whenever the boll was driven beyond the bounds, it was kicked straight in, generally a short distance<br>
only, and the players on both sides struggled for it as it fell. during one of these momentary pauses<br>
kenrick whispered to walter, i say, esson, next time its driven outside ill try to get it, and if youll</p>
