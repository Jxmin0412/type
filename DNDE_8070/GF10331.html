choice of words, they, too, were fired by the spark of the old roman enthusiasm; they gathered round<br>
him, and followed him at once to the rooms where the weapons had been deposited for use. breastplates<br>
girl on to their bodies, and swords wielded in their hands made soldiers of the sages at once, and<br>
inspired them with martial ardor. little was spoken among these heroes of the mighty word. they were<br>
bent on action. olympius had desired apuleius to go into his private room adjoining the hypostyle with<br>
porphyrius, on whose senseless and rigid state an trealment had as yet had any effect. some of the<br>
temple servants carried the merchant down a back staircase, while olympius hastily and silently led his<br>
comrades in arms up the main steps into the great halls of the temple. here the chivalrous host were<br>
doomed to surprise and disappointment greater than the most hopeless of them was prepared to meet.<br>
olympius himself for a moment despaired; for his ecstatic adherents had during the night turned to<br>
poltroons and tipplers, and the sacred precincts of the sanctuary looked as if a battle had been fought<br>
and lost there. broken and bruised furniture, smashed instruments, garments torn and wet, draggled<br>
wreaths, and faded flowers were stresin in every direction. the red wine lay in pools like blood on the<br>
scarred beauties of the inlaid pavement; here and there, at the foot of a column, lay an inert body<br>
whether dead or merely senseless who could guess and the sickening reek of hundreds of dying lamps<br>
filled the air, for in the confusion they had been left to burn as they might. and how wretched<br>
was the aspect of the sobered, terror stricken, worn out men and women. an obscure consciousness of<br>
having insulted the god and incurred his wrath lucked in every soul. to many a prompt death<br>
with the same frenzied and terror stricken haste as befoe, among the revellers, crying: it is the<br>
end all is over the world is falling asunder fire is come down from heaven the earth is in flames already<br>
i saw it with my own eyes i have come down from the roof, father where is my father at this news the<br>
company started up in fresh alarm, pappus, the mathematician, cried out: the conflagration has begun<br>
flame and fire are falling from the skies lost lost wailed eunapius; while porphyrius hastily felt in the<br>
folds of his purple garment, took out a small crystal phial and went, pale but calm, up to the high<br>
priest. he laid his hand on the arm of the friend whom he had looked up to all his life with<br>
affectionate admiration, and said with an expression of tender regret: farewell. we have often disputed<br>
over the death of calo you disapproving and i approving it. now i follow his example. look there is<br>
enough for us both. he hastily put the phial to his mouth, and part of the liquid had passed his lips<br>
before olympius understood the situation and seized his arm. the effect of the deadly fluid was instantly<br>
manifest; but porphyrius had hardly lost consciousness when apuleius had rushed to his side. the<br>
physician had succumbed to the universal panic and resigned himself doggedly to fate; but as soon as<br>
an appeal was made to his medical skill and he heard a cry for help, he had thrown off the wrapper<br>
from his head and hastened to the merchants side to combat the effects of the poison, as clear headed<br>
and decisive as in his best hours by the bed of sickness or in the lecture room. when the very backbone<br>
of the soul seems to be broken, a sense of duty is the one and last thing that holds it together and<br>
among the things that are done, and cannot be undone. the nomarch chief of a nome or district. of<br>
suan, in the southern part of the country, asked for funds for a necessary new embankment. the regent<br>
listened to his eager representation with benevolence, nay with expressions of sympathy; but assured<br>
him that the war absorbed all the funds of the state, that the chests were empty; still he felt inclined<br>
even if they had not failed to sacrifice a part of his own income to preserve the endangered arable land<br>
of his faithful province of suan, to which he desired greeting. as soon as the nomarch had left him, he<br>
commanded that a considerable sum should be taken out of the treasury, and sent after the petitioner.<br>
from time to time in the middle of conversation, he arose, and mаде a gesture of lamentation, to show<br>
to the assembled mourners in the court that he sympathized in the losses which had fallen on them. the<br>
sun had already passed the meridian, when a disturbance, accompanied by loud cries, took possession<br>
of the masses of people, who stood round the scribes in the palace court, many men and women were<br>
streaming together towards one spol, and even the most impassive of the thebans present turned their</p>
