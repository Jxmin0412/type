<p>a good thing to know weve such friendly relations. derry down. surely, said tallyho, no<br>
person could possibly be inveigled by her charms they are not very blooming just now, answered his<br>
cousin you do not see her in a right light. it is impossible to contemplate the cases of these poor<br>
creatures without dropping a tear of pity. originally seduced from a state of innocence, and eventually<br>
abandoned by their seducers, as well as their well disposed parents or friends, they are left at an early<br>
age at large upon the world; loathed and avoided by those who formerly held them in estimation, what<br>
are they to do it is said by shakespeare, that sin will pluck on sin. they seem to have no alternative,<br>
but that of continuing in the practice which they once too fatally begun, in which the major part of<br>
them end a short life of debauchery and wretchedness. exposed to the rude insults of the inebriated and<br>
the vulgar the impositions of brutal officers and watchmen to the chilling blasts of the night during<br>
the most inclement weather, in thin apparel, partly in compliance with the fashion of the day, but<br>
more frequently from the pawnbrokers shop rendering their necessary garments inaccessible, diseases<br>
where their unhappy vocation does not produce them are thus generated. many are the gradations from<br>
the highest degree of prostitution down to the trulls that parade the streets by day, and one or two<br>
more steps still include those who keep out all night. some of the miserable inhabitants of this quarter<br>
are night birds, who seldom leave their beds during the day, except to refresh themselves with a drop of<br>
old tom; but as the evening approaches, their business commences, when you will see them decked out<br>
like fine ladies, for there are coves of them, and others in the vicinity of the theatres, who live by<br>
mended, and the swords and all piercing weapons furbished up and dressed; wood was to be placed in<br>
the watch house; it was ordered that the door of the meeting house next the soldiers seat be kept clear<br>
from women and children sitting there, that if there be occasion for the soldiers to go suddenly forth,<br>
they may have free passage. the soldiers sat on either side of the main door, a sentinel was stationed<br>
in the meeting house turret, and armed watchers paced the streets; three cannon were mounted by the<br>
side of this church militant, which must strongly have resembled a garrison. military duly and military<br>
discipline and regard for the sabbath, and for the house of god as well, did not always make the well<br>
equipped occupants of these soldiers seats in new haven behave with the dignity and decorum befitting<br>
such guardians of the peace and protectors in war. serious disorders and disturbances among the guard<br>
were reported at the general court on june, one belligerent son of mars, as he sat in the meeting house,<br>
threw lumps of lime perhaps from the plastered chinks in the log wall at a fellow warrior, who in turn,<br>
very naturally, kicked his tormentor with much agility and force. there must have ensued quite a free<br>
fight all around in the meeting house, for mrs. goodyears boy had his head broke that day in meeting,<br>
on account of which a woman said she doubted not the wrath of god was upon us. and well might she<br>
think so, for divers other unseemly incidents which occurred in the meeting house at the same lime were<br>
narrated in court, examined into, and punished. in spite of these events in the new haven church which<br>
were certainly exceptional, the seemingly incongruous union of church and army was suitable enough in<br>
finish his sentence, for two reasons. one was that his brother knew so well what words were on his lips<br>
that speech was well nigh needless; the other, that he was at that moment rudely interrupted. and<br>
although the brothers had no such thought at the time, it is probable that this interruption and its<br>
consequences had a very distinct bearing upon their after lives, and certainly it produced a marked<br>
effect upon the counsel they subsequently received from their spiritual father, who, but for that episode,<br>
might strongly have dissuaded the youths from going forth so young into the world. the interruption<br>
came in the form of an angry hail from a loud and gruff voice, full of impatience and resentment. out<br>
of my path, ye base born peasants shouted a horseman who had just rounded the sharp angle taken<br>
by the narrow bridle path, and was brought almost to a standstill by the tall figures of the two<br>
stalwart youths, which took up the whole of the open way between the trees and their thick<br>
undergrowth. stand aside, ye idle loons know ye not how to make way for your betters then, in sooth, i<br>
will teach you a lesson; and a thick hide lash came whirling through the air and almost lighted upon</p>
