he was slain on his way. home; most likely by his servant anubis, who certainly knew what money he<br>
had with him, and who vanished and left no trace. because about the same lime a band of saracens<br>
had fallen on some christian anchorites and travellers, in the district between petra and aila, your<br>
mother chose to assume a right to call our father a martyr but she knew his opinions full well, i tell<br>
you, and shed many a tear over them, too. now she has expended vast sums on church building, she<br>
has opened the xenodochium and pours her money by lavish handfuls clown the insatiable throats of<br>
monks and priests. to what end to have her husband recognized as a martyr. hitherto her toil and<br>
money have been wasted. in my estimation the bishop is a perfectly detestable tyrant, and if i know<br>
him at all he will take all she will give and never grant her wish. now she is preparing her great move,<br>
and hopes to startle him into compliance by a new marvel, she thinks that, like a juggler who turns a<br>
white egg black, she can lurn a heathen district into a christian one by a twist of her finger. well as<br>
far as i am concerned i will have nothing to do with the trick. during this harangue marcus had<br>
alternately gazed at the floor and fixed his large eyes in anguish on his brothers face. for some<br>
minutes he found nothing to reply, and he was evidently going through a bitter mental struggle.<br>
demetrius spoke no more, but arranged the sheets of papyrus that strewed the table. at length marcus,<br>
after a deep sigh, broke out in a tone of fervent conviction and with a blissful smile that lighted up his<br>
whole face: poor mother and others misunderstand her just as you do; i myself was in danger of<br>

life of brother addison harper may not be out of place here. the editor was intimately acquainted with<br>
him. brother harpers early life was largely passed on the atlantic ocean as a sailor. he settled in<br>
rockingham county, virginia, in the later years of his life, and openly avowed his disbelief of holy<br>
revelation. a few years prior to the date above given he was honored by the people of his county with<br>
a seat in the virginia state legislature. when the rebellion broke out in he raised a company of<br>
confederate volunteers and served as their captain through the war. soon after the surrender, when<br>
all this has passed into history, the church has never had but one johnny kline, and it can never have<br>
another. even if born, the conditions for his development, and the sphere for his labors, have both<br>
passed away. the editor is happy to feel that he, by a wonderful providence, has been made the humble<br>
instrument by which the life work of a great and good man has been snatched from the jaws of<br>
