office into that of the director, he was glad he had come into the office so early and was able to be of<br>
service immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. the deputy directors office was,<br>
of course, still as emply as the middle of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon<br>
him too but without success. as once more he entered the reception room, two men stood up from the deep armchairs<br>
where they had been sitting, the director gave him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that was<br>
there, he immediately introduced him to the italian who shook kis hand vigorously and joked that<br>
he was an early riser. did not quite understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd<br>
expression to use and it took a little while to guess its meaning. he replied with a few bland phrases<br>
which the italian received with a laugh, passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his<br>
blue grey, bushy moustache. this moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come<br>
close to it and sniff. when they had all sat down and begun a light preliminary conversation, was<br>
disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the italian said. when he<br>
spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very infrequent, mostly the words<br>
gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying himself so much his head shook. when he was<br>
talking in this way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which seemed to to have<br>
nothing to do with italian but which the director not only understood but also spoke, although ought<br>
all the other doors in the street. the king puts a prohibitive price on meat, thinking that only the<br>
thief will be able to buy, but the thief steals a joint. however many the changes and additions of this<br>
sort kings move followed by thiefs move rung in, almost all of the stories dealing with the robbery of<br>
the kings treasury end with the pardon of the thief and his exaltation to high rank in the royal<br>
household. in none of the score of versions of the champsinitus story cited by clouston is the thief<br>
subjected to any further tests of his prowess after he has been pardoned by the king, we shall return to<br>
this point. the master thief cycle has much less to do with our stories than has the champsinitus cycle:<br>
hence we shall merely enumerate the incidents to be found in it. for bibliography of stories containing<br>
these situations, see cosquin. a hero, the youngest of three brothers, becomes a thief. for various<br>
reasons the motives are different in grimm, and dasent xxxv he displays his skill: b theft of the purse<br>
is droll: the young apprentice thief, noodle like, brings back purse to robber gang after<br>
throwing away the money. b theft of cattle being driven to the fair, this trick is usually conducted in<br>
one of four ways: a two shoes in road; b hanging self; c bawling in the wood like a strayed ox; e<br>
exciting peasants curiosity, comedy of comedies, wonder of wonders. b theft of the horse. this is usually<br>
accomplished by the disguised thief making the grooms drunk. b stealing of a live person and carrying<br>
him in a sack to the one who gave the order. the thief disguises himself as an angel, and promises to<br>
shortly, now then, what about stores i propose that two of us decide what money will be necessary, and<br>
then go over to mainton with two mule carts and spend it on such things as we shall want. that will<br>
take a week, including the obtaining a sufficiency of ammunition. which means plenty, gentlemen, for<br>
we might be regularly besieged in our wagon, and have to beat the injuns off. i dont anticipate that,<br>
replied the doctor calmly, while the boys felt their nerves tingle; but we will be prepared. then we shall<br>
come back i mean those who undertake the task will come back, and that will be all that is necessary<br>
to be done, save having one or two good discussions as to the route we shall take. then well start upon<br>
our wild quest. wild indeed, im afraid, said bourne. nay not it, cried griggs. weve got plenty of time.<br>
and plenty of room, said wilton, laughing, to be sure we have, continued griggs. lookye here, ive been<br>
thinking this little bit of a job over, and it seems to me as plain as a b c indeed said the doctor,<br>
smiling. how do you make that out this way. weve got the map of the part where it is. certainly, and<br>
all weve got to find out is whereabouts that part lies. of course: and there lies the difficulty. difficulty,<br>
nay, doctor not it. now, just look here. weve got, say, three states where its likely to be. say, at a guess,<br>
colorado, arizona, and new mexico. oh yes, and california, texas, and you can join on old mexico.<br>
nay; the three i said will do for a beginning. if neither of them turns out right well begin on one of the</p>
