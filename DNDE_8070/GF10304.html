<p>favored parts of our land, can add greatly to their crowns of rejoicing by ministering out of their<br>
abundance to the necessities of this blighted region. from manasseh judys i go fourteen miles down mill<br>
creek and across to enoch hyres on the south branch of the potomac, and all the wheat fields and corn<br>
fields in sight of the road look very much as if they might have had a shower of boiling hot rain. so<br>
nearly alike are the effects of extreme cold and extreme heat upon vegetation. monday, june meeting at<br>
enoch hyres. i speak with a weight upon my mind, if all had strong faith it would be different. but the<br>
faith of some is weak, and many have very little or no faith at all. when calamities come, like the one<br>
that now broods over the land, it is somewhat difficult to make those of weak faith still feel that god<br>
is love, and that he makes all things work together for good to them that love him. i can do no more<br>
in the way of comforting these people than to point them to the promises of the divine word. these are<br>
only assurance, that god is supremely just and good and that he can do no evil. the psalmist<br>
david said: the lord is my shepherd; i shall not want. he likewise says: i have been young, and now i<br>
am old, yet have i never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread, but it is only the eye<br>
of faith that can see the light behind the cloud. if necessary, god can make the barrel of meal and the<br>
cruse of oil as unfailing now as in the days of elijah the tishbite. my faith in him is sealed with a seal<br>
that i hope will never be broken, attend an afternoon meeting at old man parkss. stay all night at<br>
james parkss. tuesday, june meeting at bethel. speak from mark: afternoon meeting at jacob cosners.<br>
speak from hebrews ... these words have a fearful sound, and much thought should be given to their<br>
interpretation; and they should be well considered and due self examination gone through before any<br>
family was going home, apparently in a great hurry, with a fashionable headdress or hat for each one,<br>
which he had just purchased at a shop in the city. on his way he met a friend who seemed inclined to<br>
exchange courtesies and a few words with him. but he apologized for being in a hurry by holding up<br>
the hats he had bought for his girls, saying as he went: i must hurry home, or they will go out of<br>
style before my daughters get to try them on. friends, the lord claims you for his own all of you. ye<br>
are his people, ye are his souls and all your mortal frame. ye are his by creation and<br>
providence. say, will ye be his by salvation and redemption he can come to you. will the next century write<br>
the same sad history of your case that stands recorded of the jews: he came unto his own, and his own<br>
received him not will this be the story i hope and pray that it may not be. but it remains for you to<br>
decide this question. it remains for you to reject or to accept. if you receive him not, what then will<br>
your portion be think of it. but if you receive him, he will put you on the one side of eternal salvation and<br>
give you power to become the sons of god, being born of god. god himself can do no greater thing for<br>
any one than to make him his son. what he offers you here this night exceeds all the wealth and<br>
pleasures of this world, as far as the light of the sun exceeds the light of that lamp; nay, more for<br>
the sun itself shall be darkened, but the soul born of god, washed and made white in the blood of the<br>
lamb, shall be eternally safe in the possession and enjoyment of an inheritance which is incorruptible<br>
and undefiled, and that fadeth not away. repent, therefore, and believe the gospel, that your sins may<br>
necessary in this demented place. and after all mary is your mother and not mine. but she was your<br>
fathers wife, retorted marcus. would not be my brother. but she i have amply repaid<br>
any kindness she ever did me by ten years of service. we do not understand each other and we never<br>
shall. yes, yes, you will indeed. i have been in church and prayed nay, do not laugh i prayed to the<br>
lord that he would make it all work right and he well, you have been baptized and made one of his<br>
flock. to my misfortune you drive me frantic with your meek and mild ways, cried the other<br>
passionately. my own feet are strong enough for me to stand on and my hand, though it is horny, can<br>
carry out what my brain thinks right. no, no, demetrius, believe in the old gods no. i<br>
certainly, said the other with increasing irritation. you are merely talking to the winds, and my time is<br>
precious, i must pack up my small possessions, and for your sake i will say a few words of farewell<br>
when i take the account books to your mother. i have land enough belonging to myself alone, at</p>
