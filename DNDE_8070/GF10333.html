hadnt thought of that. well, we have to go on, dorothy, said the scarecrow. well do our best to protect<br>
you all, said the tin man.. the lion gingerly opened the gates and peered in. not a soul in sight, he<br>
said. maybe theyre all at a convention or something, he added hopefully. as they walked, everyone felt<br>
better. tickleland was quite pretty, really. rolling hills of green grass and clumps of trees here and<br>
there. as they approached some trees, they noticed a well. would you like a drink of water, dorothy<br>
asked the tin woodman. oh yes, please, replied dorothy, im quite thirsty. as the tin man.. lovered the<br>
bucket, he began to relax. well, remarked the scarecrow, it looks as though we may walk right<br>
through tickleland without seeing one ticklemonster. ticklelands not very big, you know. look, there the<br>
borders right there. everyone turned in the direction he was pointing in and, sure enough, the boгдег<br>
was about the same distance as theyd traveled so far. what a relief, said dorothy as the tin woodman<br>
handed her a ladle of water from the well. mmmm, this is good, said dorothy. so refreshing, surprise<br>
said a loud voice. everyone jumped. they turned to see about twenty ticklemonsters who quickly<br>
surrounded them. we are so glad to see you, said one who appeared to be their leader. he was a little<br>
taller than the others and was the one who had greeted them so abruptly, we welcome you to<br>
tickleland, he continued, bending over in a mock bow. i might add that we are all very hungry, so we<br>
doubly welcome you. grab those two he said, pointing to the lin woodman and scarecrow. six of the<br>
ticklemonsters quickly jumped on them and held their arms and legs. now, said the leader, lets have<br>
a feast oh, no, said the lion, beginning to laugh uncontrollably, i wont be able to stand it. the<br>
matter of course. then he looked at trustingly which, despite all his friendliness, he had not done<br>
until then, and added, theyre always rebelling. but the conversation seemed to have become a little<br>
uncomfortable for him, so he broke it off by saying, now i have to report to the office. would you like<br>
to come with me theres nothing for me to do there, said youd be able to have a look at it. as you will<br>
any notice of you. is it worth seeing then asked hesitatingly, although he felt very keen to go<br>
with him. well, said the usher, i thought youd be interested in it. alright then, said finally, ill come<br>
with you. and, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps. at the entrance he nearly fell over,<br>
behind the door there was another step, they dont show much concern for the public, he said, they<br>
dont show any concern at all, said the usher, just look at the waiting room here. it consisted of a long<br>
corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. there was no<br>
source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments, instead of solid walls,<br>
had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. the light made its<br>
way in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat<br>
writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor<br>
through the gaps. there were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it was sunday, they<br>
were not very impressive. they sat, equally spaced, on two rows of long wooden benches which had been<br>
placed along both sides of the corridor. all of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions<br>
plan into execution. the expected express arrived with several letters, but the emperor did not come<br>
back. it grew dark, and heavy rain drops fell from the overcast sky, and still antinous was alone. his<br>
anxious longing was mingled with regret for the lost opportunity of seeing selene and alarm at the<br>
emperors prolonged absence, in spite of the rain, which began to fill more violently, he went out into<br>
the open air, of which the sweltering oppressiveness had helped to fetter his feeble volition, and called<br>
to the dogs, with whose help he proposed seeking the emperor; but just then he heard the bark of<br>
argus, and soon after hadrian and mastor stepped out of the darkness into the brightness which shone<br>
out from the tent, where lights were burning. the emperor gave his favorite but a brief greeting and<br>
silently submitted while antinous dried his hair and brought him some refreshments, and mastor bathed<br>
his feet and dressed him in fresh garments. as he reclined with the bithyman, before the supper which<br>
was standing ready, he said: a strange evening how hot and oppressive the atmosphere is. we must be<br>
on the lookout, something serious is brewing, what happened to you, my lord many things. at the door</p>
